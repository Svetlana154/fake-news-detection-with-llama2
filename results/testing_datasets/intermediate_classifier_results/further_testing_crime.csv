1866,1866,"GAITHERSBURG, Md. and GUANGZHOU, China , Jan. 24, Sirnaomics Inc. (""Sirnaomics""), a leading biopharmaceutical company in discovery and development of novel RNAi therapeutics, announced today that it has mobilized its research teams both in USA and China to develop novel RNAi-based prophylactics and therapeutics for treatment of patients suffering from Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) caused by the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the outbreak of respiratory illness that is caused by a novel coronavirus (termed ""2019-nCov"") and was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province , China , continues to spread. In addition to confirmed cases in multiple provinces in China (as of January 24, 2020 ), human-to-human infections with the virus have been confirmed in Thailand , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , Singapore , Vietnam and USA . The total confirmed number of patients infected by 2019-nCoV is 929, with 26 deaths in Hubei Province , China .
The Sirnaomics R&D team has an established track record of using siRNA prophylactics and therapeutics to treat SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza and other respiratory viral infections, with multiple animal models including non-human primate. The team's expertise covers siRNA drug design (silencing the most critical viral genes), respiratory tract siRNA delivery formulation, large scale GMP drug production and clinical investigations. To fight against SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics team has already identified potentially potent siRNAs, specifically targeting the viral genes critical for the viral infection and replication. Collaborating with laboratories having cell culture models of 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics expects to develop multiple siRNA drug candidates.
Patrick Lu , PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, ""This is a critical time for treating SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV to mitigate further spreading of the deadly disease. RNAi as a naturally evolved antiviral mechanism has been demonstrated in various in vitro and in vivo models. Our team's in-depth knowledge and experience using RNAi technology to fight respiratory viral infection in the previous SARS outbreak will add on to our antiviral weaponry to fight SARI. The unique siRNA drug design and chemical modification, respiratory specific siRNA delivery formulation, and the handheld nebulizer device are providing a clear pathway for developing novel siRNA therapeutics and prophylactics against 2019-nCoV infection.""

In an interview on Wednesday, DOH-1 Regional Director Valeriano Lopez said as of the morning of Feb. 4, there is no truth on the circulating news on social media of certain confirmed cases in the region.
""Wala pa po tayong kumpirmadong kaso ng 2019 n-CoV sa Region 1,"" he told the Philippine Information Agency.
However, he verified that three individuals from China have been admitted in a government hospital in the region and were classified yesterday as patient under investigation (PUI).
He said the patients submitted themselves to the hospital on Jan. 26 for having some of the symptoms of nCov which are colds and fever. They were immediately isolated upon initial check up.
""Since their admission, these PUIs have been getting better and over the course of their admission, they have been showing signs of improvement on their health,"" the regional director said.
He added,"" I would like to reiterate that strict infection control measures and isolation standards are being implemented in the health facility where they are admitted.""
Further, he informed that they are expecting for the confirmatory test from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to reveal whether these patients are positive or negative for the 2019-nCoV.
While waiting for the results, Lopez advised the public to remain calm and heed advisories from credible sources of information and updates with regard to the disease.

2041,2041,"Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte on Monday announced the cancellation of the citys events for the 83rd Araw ng Dabaw celebration amid a novel coronavirus epidemic.
In a social media post, Duterte said, We have been following the pronouncements of the Department of Health and it has released last February 7 the advisory on public gatherings, thus it is with a heavy heart that I have decided to cancel the following events:""
- Pasiugdang Pagsaulog - Parada Dabawenyo, and - the Datu Bago Awards
Araw ng Dabaw is a city-wide celebration for the anniversary of Davao City on March 16.
We have seen an increasing number of people getting the infection worldwide. Our health care facilities in Davao City have limitations and we cannot possibly carry hundreds of sick individuals all at the same time, Duterte said of the novel coronavirus that has already claimed the lives of more than 900 people and infected over 40,000 mainly in China and in several other countries.
Duterte laments there is still no answer when it (the epidemic) will be stabilized or its spread across the globe be fully controlled.
Three Chinese travelers have tested positive for the 2019-nCoV while in the Philippines, although health officials regard them as ""imported cases"" as the patients came from the Chinese City of Wuhan where the virus originated. So far, 281 others in the country were monitored for possible infection.
On Friday, the Philippine health department issued an advisory strongly urging the public to avoid attending, participating in, and organizing events that draw a huge number of attendees. The agency recommended the cancellation of such events until further notice.
In line with the city government's plan to avoid the spread of the infection, Duterte urged Davao City residents to learn more about the virus and how they can keep their families safe.
It is important to keep your immune system strong. Avoid crowded places and activities that will propagate the spread of the virus, she said.
Duterte said preparations made for the 2020 events will instead be used for the 2021 Araw ng Dabaw celebration.
The mayor also announced that starting Feb. 11, all welcome and send-off groups at airports, seaports, bus terminals, and other transportation hubs"" are prohibited.
In addition to precautions against the 2019-nCoV, it is also for safety and security, she said.
Only port and terminal employees, drivers and passengers will be allowed in those areas.
Duterte also ordered the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the price freeze memorandum of the DOH, the price tag, suggested retail price and other pertinent regulations on all goods and commodities are strictly implemented.
Business permits of stores caught selling overpriced items and hoarding food and other supplies shall be canceled and their establishment padlocked, she said.
She advised people with sore throat, cough, fever, and other flu-like symptoms to avoid travel and seek medical assistance.
Schools, offices and business establishments are advised to come up with guidelines to ensure that students and employees who are sick are not allowed entry to the school or workplace, Duterte said.
While we have a health issue at hand, please DO NOT PANIC. Instead, report to the authorities and seek immediate and appropriate medical help.",HEALTH,CRIME,1
2053,2053,"In a bid to avert the possible outbreak of Lassa fever and Corona virus in the nations capital, the FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has flagged off sensitization and awareness campaign in Gwagwalada Area Council of the territory.
The awareness campaign according to the minister was aimed at ensuring that residents especially mothers take up responsibilities in preventing Lassa fever and corona virus diseases outbreaks in the territory, stressing that the battle against these global diseases should be the collective responsibility of both government and personal commitment.
FCTA takes Lassa fever sensitisation campaign to markets
Aliyu, used the occasion to task religious leaders, traditional institutions and civil society organisations to join hands in the sensitization campaign, just as she charged Area Council chairmen in the FCT to replicate this in markets and other locations in their various councils.
She explained that one of the key preventive measures for Lassa fever and corona virus infections is neighbour to neighbour information and to conduct advocacy and sensitisation visits to communities, markets and other places where people live and gather, hence the need to intensify the awesomeness campaign.
The minister who revealed that transmission from person to person can occur following exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of an infected individual, however called for promotion of good environmental and personal hygiene in individual homes.
According to her, Humans become infected from direct contact with the urine and faeces of the rat which contains the virus, through touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to open cuts or sores.
Transmission from person to person can occur following exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of an infected individual. Promoting good environmental and personal hygiene are to discourage rodents from entering homes and markets and having access to food stuff.
The minister pledged the FCT Administrations commitment to all activities aimed at strengthening the awareness and prevention of Lassa fever and corona virus diseases and outbreaks in FCT, while reminding parents and caregivers to ensure that they follow all the preventive measures.
In his remarks, chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Hon. Adamu Mustapha Danze, commended the administration for taking proactive steps toward curbing the outbreak of Lassa fever and corona virus in the territory.
He observed that taking the campaign to market women was a step in the right direction, adding that when women and mothers take leadership positions in matters of public health importance, the results are usually great and rewarding to families and society at large.
While enlightening the public, the Director of Public Health of Health and Human Service Secretariat, Dr. Okechukwu Josephine, revealed that Lassa fever is an epidemic prone zoonotic disease, adding that it is an acute viral illness, a haemorrhagic fever that was first reported in Lassa community in Borno state, where two missionary nurses died from an unusual febrile illness.

2095,2095,"As we have said, the silver ray is the feminine frequency within the body and the golden ray is the masculine frequency. When these merge or marry together (like two flints rubbing together), they create an internal fire (phire) that manifests as the rose gold ray or rose gold flame as it is activated. We also used the analogy of three aspects to the trinity. Each aspect being one unit of 33 and one third. We could say that the silver (female) aspect is one 33 and one third unit and the golden (male) aspect is the second 33 and one third unit. The third 33 and one third unit is the creation or the child (the rose gold flame). One symbol that shows this trinity field through geometry is the Celtic knot or triquetra. The twin flame presentation of the vesica piscis geometry depicts the masculine, the feminine and the creation as one aspect of the overall trinity, yet is a trinity in itself. Every aspect to each individualised, infinite structure is a holographic replica of the greater and the lesser aspect. Every structure is an emanation of another structure. The triquetra simply shows us the expanded presentation of the vesica piscis.
A quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire journey of the DNA, if you will.
The first exercise we show you, involving the rose gold flame and the utilisation of the Schumann resonance as the antidote to the 5G scrambled field and the black box programme, is to use the symbol of the triquetra. There are several ways this can be done.
Meditation
Firstly, you can meditate upon the triquetra simply by visualising the symbol within meditation. You can also move into an open-eyed meditation where you are in a relaxed, meditative space whilst looking at the triquetra symbol. You can also look at the symbol as the very last image you look at before you go to sleep at night. This is especially helpful if you wish to use dream magick and dream healing as part of your antidote creation. If you do decide to use the triquetra symbol as a trigger into dreamtime investigation/magick and healing, then you must prepare your sleeping space before you do this. If you are sleeping outdoors in nature, there is no need to prepare your space as nature has already done this for you. Indoors, you would need to make sure all Wi-Fi and Internet signals are turned off in your home and all electronic equipment is removed from your bedroom. Make sure there is no metal within the mattress or bed frame you sleep upon, and do your best to utilise chemical-free bedding. Having crystals in your bedroom is especially helpful. Orgonite also.
Within your meditation or visualisation (closed or open-eyed looking at the triquetra image), imagine that the triquetra is a brilliant and bright silver colour. Make sure you hold that beautiful silver colour in your minds eye. You should feel an opening of the heart when doing this. Then imagine that the triquetra symbol is becoming a golden colour, getting brighter and brighter until all the silver colour has now been replaced with the gold. Then visualise the gold changing colour, taking on a pink hue and eventually becoming rose gold in colour. This is a very simple but very powerful exercise. This will trigger downloads within dreamtime or meditation if you are a natural medium or channel. This exercise in itself can bring about balance and natural healing.
To strengthen and boost this exercise, you can keep rose quartz crystal by your bedside. A crystal wand or a crystal skull holds even more powerful, activating energy.
A quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire journey of the DNA, if you will.
Shields that connect into Schumann resonance fields can also be created through water. Swimming in natural ocean water is an extremely powerful shield as the Schumann resonance is amplified through the oceans upon your planet. This can be recreated within your own bathtubs at home using Himalayan salts or any magnesium-based salts. Certain aromatherapy creations and herbs can also create shielding, as can placing crystals within the bathtub. The only case where it is not advisable to create a water shield in your bathtub, is when your bath is made of metal. This would scramble the signal and have the opposite effect (as in, lack of shield and focus away from Schumann resonance). The most powerful material for creating a water shield is stone such as crystal, followed by wood. A crystal bathtub full of sea salt is an absolute replica of the ocean and creates a super conductor directly into the Schumann resonance fields. We also recommend you utilise a heavy metal detoxification programme. The reason for this is that metals within the organic human body system can lock. on to the Wi-Fi 5G scrambled system and amplify it, so cleansing from heavy metals within the body is a shield in itself. The dark green leafy vegetables from the land and the seaweeds from unpolluted waters are able to chelate these heavy metals from the body. We recommend the blue-green algae also, such as chlorella and spirulina.
When you visualise the rose gold flame, you create an image in your minds eye that activates through the pineal gland visual cortex system. The rose gold (and indeed the symbol of the rose itself) is a known symbol within what we may call the cosmic alphabet or the language of light. When you visualise the rose gold flame, you speak directly to the DNA. When you create the rose gold flame as a shield, then the molecular structure within your body as silicate/crystalline follows suit (through a process similar to that which is known as cymaticsand your entire energy field naturally keys into the Schumann resonance.
If enough individuals hold this belief system and follow similar spiritual exercises, then collectively the Schumann resonance will be spiked and kept at a high enough frequency to drown out the 5G network and chemical bombardment. Either in meditation or in a relaxed state, we would ask you to visualise a silver candle and a gold candle. Both these candles burn one flame each. The silver candle burns a golden flame. The gold candle burns a silver flame. Sit with this visualisation for a few minutes, simply watching the candles and the burning flames. This exercise balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain, as well as communicating directly with the DNA about the shielding technique you are employing. The intrinsic intelligence within the cellular structure of the entire bodymind knows what you are doing. After a while, we would ask you to draw the candles closer and closer together until the silver candle burning a golden flame and the gold candle burning a silver flame become one candle and one flame. As the candles merge together, gold and silver, the colour of the candle begins to turn a beautiful rose colour with a matching rose coloured flame.
Yet The sparkle of the gold remains, creating a rose gold colour. You are now watching a rose gold candle burning a rose gold flame, and you are fully aware that the rose gold is a merge of the silver and the gold. Know that the right hemisphere of the brain (silver) and the left hemisphere of the brain (gold) have created a unified brain pattern, where the left and right hemispheres are in equal balance. Within the pineal gland, a beautiful diamond liquid crystal of a metallic rose gold colour has been created. This rose gold crystal liquid then seeps down from the brain stem into the throat, and you visualise yourself drinking this rose gold liquid. Know that this is ambrosia or indeed nectar of the Gods. As you drink this delicious and sweet nectar, you visualise the flame of the rose gold candle getting bigger and bigger. The rose gold flame begins to surround you, like a ring of fire around you. The candle has unified with the flame and now, sitting in sacred space, there is just you surrounded by the rose gold flame ring of fire. Allow this ring of fire to completely surround you until it eventually becomes a ball of fire, like a rose-gold-pink orb, with you sitting in the centre, nurtured and protected.

Ever since the novel coronavirus made headlines in December 2019, a number of people have been confused, thinking the disease is somehow related to a popular brand of beer: Corona.
Results on Google Trends show a disturbing number of people have looked up Corona Beer Virus and Beer Virus since December. On January 25, some 100 people around the world looked up Beer Virus, while 88 looked up Corona Beer Virus.
The Philippines is among the top countries that searched for the two keywords, placing 13th on the list after the United States and Australia. Meanwhile, memes about Corona Beer and coronavirus are circulating on social media.

 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) January 21, 2020 For the sake of people googling Corona Beer Virus and Beer Virus, we decided to answer some of these questions.
1| What is coronavirus? It is a family of viruses that includes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), so called because of the spikes on the surface of the virus, which seems to form a corona or crown. The current novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China is a new strain.
2| Is coronavirus deadly? The currently spreading novel coronavirus is highly infectious and has killed 170 people as of this writing. Yes, it is deadly.
3| Where does coronavirus come from?
Not from Corona or beer. Scientists think the novel coronavirus is a strain that jumped from snakes to humans, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology . The virus has since mutated to be able to pass from human to human through coughing and sneezing.
4| Where does Corona Beer come from? Corona is produced in Mexico and is the top-selling imported beer in the United States. In the Philippines, Corona is available in groceries and convenience stores nationwide.",HEALTH,CRIME,0

The price of a gram of gold in Egypt today, Friday, January 31, 2020, amounted to 694 pounds for the 21st caliber, compared to 678 pounds per gram in the first days of the new year. The price of a gram of 18 carat gold rose during the month of January to 594.9 pounds, and 24 carats to 793.2 pounds, while the price of a pound of gold recorded 5552 pounds. The yellow metal prices worldwide witnessed great strides during the first month of the year, as a safe haven, due to the tensions in the Middle East region (between America and Iran) and the fear of the spread of Corona virus that appeared in China. During todays trading, gold prices fell globally, after the World Health Organization reassured about the measures China is taking to confront the virus, which has spread to 16 countries around the world. The gold prices in Egypt during the year rose by about 39 pounds per gram in 2019, by 6.1% per gram of 21 karat, compared to the end of 2018. The increase comes amid expectations of a rise in the yellow metal this year, as investment bank Goldman Sachs expects the global ounce to reach $ 1,600 in 2020. The bank said that the demand for the yellow metal as an investment tool will be supported by recession fears and political uncertainty, according to Reuters.

3300,3300,"Flights with no passengers, infection dangers and plummeting earnings for pilots, people fearful of traveling  Vietnams aviation industry is hurting badly. For the first time in his career this week, flight captain Hoang operated two flights with no passengers. ""Every time I fly an empty jet, the airline has to bear a cost of at least VND500-700 million ($21,500-30,100)."" Hoang, who has been working for an airline for five years now, estimated that flight crew working hours have fallen by half after the deadly novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. This means that their salary has dropped while they also face the risk being infected when carrying passengers. Two flight crews of Vietnam Airlines were recently quarantined for 14 days after carrying an infected Chinese passenger on a flight from Zhengzhou City in China to Nha Trang Town in central Vietnam. Industry insiders say that the nCoV outbreak could have a severe impact on aviation growth this year as tourists from China , where the outbreak has originated, accounted for 32 percent of Vietnams travel market last year. Airway agents are reporting dwindling number of customers. Thu, a salesperson in Hanois Thanh Xuan District, estimated that the number of customers have fallen several times over the same period last year. ""Ticket sales to Australia, China, Japan and South Korea have plummeted. People are also scrapping plans to local destinations like Da Nang, Hanoi, Da Lat and Nha Trang,"" she said. Hoa, who runs a travel agency in Saigons Go Vap District, says many groups of 3-5 tourists have canceled their plans to visit Hanoi pagodas, a tradition after the Lunar New Year ( Tet ) holiday. ""If the situation persists the business could be in a crisis this summer and might have to cut down staff,"" she said. Vietnam Airlines CEO Duong Tri Thanh said that the airline was taking a hit from the cancellation of 30 Vietnam-China flights everyday, as also limited travel between Vietnam and Macau and Hong Kong. The national flag carrier also has to bear the additional cost of sanitizing its aircraft to contain nCoV spread, he noted. A senior Jetstar Pacific official who wished to remain unnamed said that revenue from both international and domestic flights has fallen. ""Airlines leaders have been getting together these days to come up with solutions to improve business. We are asking for more support from the government."" Do Xuan Quang, deputy director of budget carrier Vietjet Air, called the outbreak ""a disaster for the aviation industry."" Local airports have reported falling figures. The number of passengers from and to the Cam Ranh International Airport near Nha Trang and the Da Nang International Airport, both in central Vietnam, have dropped by 30-50 percent year-on-year, according to the Airports Corporation of Vietnam (ACV). The ACV also has to bear the costs for sanitizing 24 airports. In 2003, after the SARS epidemic, the growth in the number of air passengers fell by 1.7 percentage points. The Vietnamese aviation industry, which has being flying high for several years now, has been brought low by the ongoing nCoV epidemic. Last year, Vietnamese airports served near 116 million passengers, up 12 percent from 2018, according to the ACV. ",HEALTH,CRIME,1

Within the framework of the response to the crisis linked to the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) coordinated by the Ministry for Solidarity and Health, the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs planned, in conjunction with the Ministry for Solidarity and Health, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry for the Armed Forces, an operation to return to European territory by direct flight from Wuhan (China) those French nationals and citizens from Europe and partner countries who wished to return.
In a spirit of European solidarity and in order to give European countries the opportunity to allow those citizens wishing to do so to take advantage of the flights it was providing France took the initiative on January 28 to activate the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. From the outset, foreign nationals, especially European nationals, were included in the planning of the repatriation operations.
The first flight on board a military plane belonging to Esterel Squadron (Airbus A340) left Wuhan and returned 180 French nationals to France on January 31.
A second civilian plane (Airbus A380), which also departed from Wuhan, landed in Istres on February 2 at 2:30 pm with 291 people from 30 countries, including France, on board: 254 passengers: 64 French nationals and eligible persons as well as 190 foreigners, including 135 nationals from the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) and 55 nationals of third countries (Brazil, Georgia, North Macedonia, Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, the United Kingdom, Rwanda, Serbia, the Seychelles and Switzerland); 37 support staff, including 31 French nationals (25 government officials and 6 employees of the aircraft charter company) and 6 consular officials of third countries.
The two planes chartered by the French government also delivered medical equipment to Wuhan, donated by France to China to help address the coronavirus crisis.
At the request of the countries concerned, most European nationals were transferred to their countries of origin immediately upon arrival in France.
Very strict health measures have been applied to the entire operation; in particular, a 14-day quarantine is required upon arrival. This measure applies to both citizens and foreigners residing on French soil.
This operation was conducted by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs Crisis and Support Center (CDCS) in coordination with the Ministry for Solidarity and Health, the Ministry for the Armed Forces, and the Ministry of the Interior. It was also carried out in close coordination with foreign partners, notably European institutions, EU member states and concerned third countries.
France wishes to underscore the effective cooperation with the Chinese authorities that made the smooth conduct of this operation possible. Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in fact discussed this subject with his counterpart, Wang Yi.
The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs remains particularly attentive to the concerns of our compatriots abroad. Since January 23, our embassy in Beijing, our consulate-general in Wuhan and Ministry agencies have mobilized all their efforts in response to the Coronavirus crisis. Frances consulate-general in Wuhan is in constant contact with our compatriots in Hubei and is monitoring their situation. The minister publicly applauded the services of the Quai dOrsays Crisis and Support Center, our embassy in Beijing and our Consulate-General in Wuhan, which were exemplary and were utterly at the service of our compatriots to reassure them on one hand, and to help repatriate them on the other.",HEALTH,CRIME,1

India is preparing itself after it has learnt from WHO (World Health Organization) that the infections of the virus are linked to sea food market. Managing the importation of the virus into the country is being strengthened.
International travelers from China are being examined thoroughly using thermal scanners. These are currently being done at Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata international terminals.
The Health Ministry has issued directions to laboratory diagnosis, infection prevention and surveillance of the virus.
The other measures of Health Ministry is as follows Ministry of External Affairs has been requested to provide details of travelers from Wuhan city where the virus is spreading rapidly The states have been instructed to increase area of surveillance and laboratory support infection prevention and control. The Joint Monitoring Group operating under DGHS (Directorate General of Health Services) meets to assess risks. WHO attends the meeting and provides regular updates. GoI has issued travel advisory National Institute of Virology, Pune has been appointed the nodal agency to test the virus samples. Rapid Response Teams that are trained in MERS-CoV outbreak have been set up in states and union territories. Sea Food Scenario in India
The chances of India being the victim of the virus is minimal. This is because Indias imports of sea food are highly limited. According to 2018 report of MPEDA (Marine Products Export Development Authority), India exported sea food (fish predominantly) worth of 6,923 million USD and imported 138 million USD. USA is the predominant import destination of India according to MPEDA. Import of sea food from other countries is miniscule or negligent. As far as China is considered, Japan is its leading importer of sea food from China, followed by USA, Hong Kong and Korea.

Goldman was early out stating that a SARS like event would knock $3/bl off the oil price. That is exactly what we have seen so far in broad terms. Nervousness in the market is now starting to come off a little bit. With 25 reported deaths vs 830 officially infected (+1,027 suspected cases) we are looking at a death rate of 3%. In comparison the SARS virus in 2003 had a death rate of 10%. Also, it turns out that the Corona virus was discovered already in December. It has thus been around for a little longer making the sense of explosive spreading a little less explosive. Bjarne Schieldrop, Chief analyst commodities, SEB
It is still too early to call off the scare totally but concerns and tension is a little lower now than just a day or two ago. The lunar holiday in China with a lot of traveling has the potential to spread the virus so the market is awaiting to see how that turns out. So, a little too early for a strong rebound in the oil price yet, but the worst from the first sell-off may be behind us. Then wait and see how this spread over the lunar holiday. Everyone knows that sooner or later well get a repetition of the 1918 Spanish flue which infected 500 million people and killed as many as 100 million. But this one does not look like the one. S&P Ratings is out warning that if the situation gets worse it could knock off 1.2 percent of Chinese GDP growth this year. Oil demand is naturally exposed to this kind of event as traveling is reduced.

4768,4768,"We are now facing a global virus pandemic which has a real measurable death rate. The best system to stem the disease is the uses of an off the shelf nebulizer and colloidal silver. Obviously this should always be our first recourse for all forms of infectious agents. It has worked well for over a century and the focus needs to be now on best practice.
You need this knowledge. Nothing else is likely to work as well and may even be suspect. This is likely to be your best option and it also applies to a lot of other chronic low level infection situations that we may suffer from.
The real danger is barely apparent yet. that will obviously change soon enough..
Getting Colloidal Silver Into the System
Quickly and Effectively
A nebuliser is a device that converts liquid into aerosol droplets suitable for inhalation. Nebulisers use oxygen, compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up medication solutions and deliver a therapeutic dose of aerosol particles directly to the lungs.
Pressurized air passes through the tube and turns the liquid treatment into a mist. During an asthma attack or an infection, the mist may be easier to inhale than the spray from a pocket inhaler. When your airways become narrow  like during an asthma attack  you cant take deep breaths. For this reason, a nebulizer is a more effective way to deliver things like colloidal silver etc than an inhaler, which requires you to take a deep breath.
The expanding clinical challenge of respiratory tract infections due to resistant bacteria necessitates the development of new forms of therapy. The development of a compound composed of silver coupled to a methylated caffeine carrier (silver carbene complex 1 [SCC1]) that demonstrated in vitro efficacy against bacteria, including drug-resistant organisms, isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections was described previously. The findings of current in vitro studies now suggest that bactericidal concentrations of SCC1 are not toxic to airway epithelial cells in primary culture, In the nineteenth century, colloidal silver -- also known as Argentum colloidale, Argentum crede and collargolum -- was a prominent treatment for everything from colds to skin infections. In the 1940s, the FDA began its decades-long oppression of medicinal silver under the guise that it was unsafe; however, in reality, the FDA banned silver because of the threat it poses to the antibiotics industry, rather than any threat it poses for your body. Some countries completely dissagree with the FDA
'We are constantly filtering all kinds of bacteria As Phyllis A. Balch and Dr. James F. Balch write in Prescription for Nutritional Healing, colloidal silver can safely and inexpensively protect you from infection in a wide variety of ways: ""Topically, it can be used to fight fungal infections of the skin or nails and to promote the healing of burns, wounds, cuts, rashes, and sunburn. It can be used on toothaches and mouth sores, as eye drops and as a gargle to fight tooth decay and bad breath. It can also be used as sterilizer and can even be sprayed on air-conditioning filters and air ducts and vents to prevent germs from growing."" In addition to those found in air conditioning vents, germs make many other aspects of our environment both unhealthy as healthy as it can make your body. Getting Colloidal Silver Into the System,
Quickly and Effectively
""Like werewolves and vampires, bacteria have a weakness: silver. The precious metal has been used to fight infection for thousands of years  Hippocrates first described its antimicrobial properties in 400 bc  but how it works has been a mystery. Now, a team led by James Collins, a biomedical engineer at Boston University in Massachusetts, has described how silver can disrupt bacteria, and shown that the ancient treatment could help to deal with the thoroughly modern scourge of antibiotic resistance. The work is published today in Science Translational Medicine ""
Resistance is growing, while the number of new antibiotics in development is dropping, says Collins. We wanted to find a way to make what we have work better.
""Collins and his team found that silver  in the form of dissolved ions  attacks bacterial cells in two main ways: it makes the cell membrane more permeable, and it interferes with the cells metabolism, leading to the overproduction of reactive, and often toxic, oxygen compounds. Both mechanisms could potentially be harnessed to make todays antibiotics more effective against resistant bacteria, Collins says.
Many antibiotics are thought to kill their targets by producing reactive oxygen compounds, and Collins and his team showed that when boosted with a small amount of silver these drugs could kill between 10 and 1,000 times as many bacteria.""
Science and Medicine
Infectious diseases, accounts for over 7% of the deaths in the US, and major expenditures.
Antibiotic resistance is a major problem .
 The CDC estimates that 76,000,000 get sick from food borne illnesses. Influenza, rotavirus and RSV each sicken and hospitalize thousands of kids every year. About 100,000 to 135,000 people are hospitalized with pneumococcal pneumonia every year. And about 30% of these patients have bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Is There Some Other Way To Get Colloidal Silver Into the Body, Quickly and Effectively? Inhalation of Silver Nanoparticles Results in ""Miraculous"" Protection Against colds, flu, pneumonia and other upper respiratory infections
Our report on the use of aerosolized silver as an antimicrobial for pulmonary infections joins a recent resurgence in interest in silver compounds that includes the development of several different preparations for topical use, some of which incorporate nanocrystalline silver (5, 10). This report is the first to investigate the direct nebulization of a silver carbene complex in solution as a potential therapy for pulmonary infections. Given that SCC1 appears to be safe and effective in these animal models of lung infection, further studies of SCC1 and other silver carbene compounds, either directly aerosolized in solution or in a nanoparticle suspension (17), appear to be warranted. Nebulized silver-based antimicrobials may serve as useful adjuncts to the current therapies for difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections. This work was supported by awards to C.L.C. and S.L.B. from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (awards HL04277 and HL077382, respectively); to C.L.C. and W.J.Y. from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (award AI067856); to C.L.C. as a Scholar of the Child Health Research Center in Developmental Biology at the Washington University School of Medicine (award HD01487); to W.J.Y. from the National Science Foundation (award 0315980); and to the Children's Discovery Institute of St. Louis Children's Hospital and the Washington University School of Medicine for support of the lung epithelial cell core.
Microbe Tested: Candida albicans [ Example of Candida albicans ]
Results: Reduction of population counts from >1 billion to undetectable in two minutes. Source Dr. Victor Marcial-Vega is a board-certified oncologist and the director of Health Horizons Rejuvenation Clinic in Coral Gables, Florida.
And we have the prestigious Health Sciences Institute (HSI) to thank for bringing this to our attention.
You see, HSI addressed this very topic in an e-alert to their members, back in October 2001, shortly after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and subsequent anthrax attacks on our nation.
As the HSI pointed out at the time, one of their well-known health symposium panelists, Dr. Marcial-Vega, had discovered while dealing with pneumonia patients the fact that colloidal silver can be quickly and easily carried into the human blood stream and from there into the body's cells and tissues, simply by nebulizing it.
Nonetheless, in each model, the SCC1 aerosol decreased the lung bacterial burden, indicating that it had a beneficial antibacterial effect. Nebulizing is a process by which colloidal silver is run through a small medical device called a nebulizer which turns the colloidal silver solution into a fine mist. Th is fine mist can easily be breathed into the lungs as its produced by the machine. And from the lungs the body can efficiently and effectively distribute the colloidal silver straight into the blood stream, cells and tissues. Here's what the Health Sciences Institute told their members:
""Based on his experience treating other types of bacterial lung infections, Dr. Marcial-Vega believes he has discovered a way to prevent anthrax from developing even if you've already been exposed. Dr. Marcial-Vega says there are no concerns about using this treatment because colloidal silver has no toxicity and no side effects if used intelligently. He has used the colloidal silver nebulizer treatments on infants, the elderly, and AIDS patients with pneumonia and has seen great results. All have responded quickly to the treatment even when no other approach seemed to help - and no one reported any adverse reactions.
 Nebulizers are widely used to treat asthma, and are readily available at stores nationwide. The cost generally runs between $69 and $120 for the machine. Each member of the family should have their own mask, and both adult and pediatric sizes are available for a few dollars each. But the entire family can share the nebulizer machine and the tubing. He's currently talking with government health authorities about testing his hypothesis on live anthrax spores, but asked us bring this information directly to you now.
Just in his last decade of medical practice, Dr. Marcial-Vega has treated hundreds of people with a variety of viral, fungal, and bacterial pneumonias. And of all the available treatments, he has seen the greatest success with nebulizer treatments using a colloidal silver preparation.
COLLOIDAL SILVER VERSUS BACTERIA AND VIRUSES
As single celled creatures called bacteria use a common type enzyme or 'chemical lung"" for their oxygen metabolism, the presence of colloidal silver cripples the enzyme, therefore causing the organism to suffocate. Any and all bacteria are therefore killed within the 6-minute time frame, without causing any adverse effect on the surrounding tissue cells. Dr Becker also states in his book: ""Positive Silver kills all types of bacteria"". This is exiting, because no other single antibiotic works against all types of bacteria. Colloidal silver, however, offers several advantages over previous forms. There are no ions besides silver to burden tissues. It works against all types of bacteria and viruses, even killing antibiotic resistant strains as well as all fungal /yeast infections.
HOW IT WORKS AGAINST VIRUSES
A single virus will invade a living cell within the body tissue. Then the insidious pathogen will take over the nucleus of the cell and alter it's production and reproduction chanism to replicate the irus instead of the enzyme, hormone, or other chemical that the body would normally have produced for itself within that cell. Later, the newly produced virus will be released from that cell and into the blood stream. However, another very interesting thing takes place. As the virus affects the cell for its own purposes, part of the response of that living cell is that it reverts back to a more primitive form of cell structure and chemistry. The oxygen metabolising enzyme, or chemical lung in the cell wall, reverts as well. This more primitive form of enzyme is vulnerable to the effects of colloidal silver. The catalyst effect of the colloidal silver simply being in close proximity to the enzyme of this cell results in the enzyme becoming permanently disabled. It cannot function to bring oxygen into the cell, and the virus producing cell dies by suffocation.
""I have a friend who has suffered for years from chronic pneumonitis, caused by Pseudomonas.
Sputum cultures were consistently positive, despite massive doses of horribly expensive antibiotics. Then colloidal silver was suggested, and taken. Sputum cultures since have been negative, and the patient's general health and vitality greatly improved. Her internist can't deny the improvement, but won't attribute it to the silver, of course! It would have occurred anyway; the silver just happened to come on the scene at the right time. Uh-huh."" -- Dr. Paul Hine, M.D. (retired ophthalmologist) In the above case, pneumonitis caused by Pseudomonas infection was apparently easily cured by colloidal silver, even after ""massive doses"" of prescription antibiotics had failed.
