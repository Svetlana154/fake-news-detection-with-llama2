113,113,"According to Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, the first patient since the beginning of the deadly outbreak has been cured and discharged from hospital. 
The patient identifed as 56-year-old woman identified as 'Chen' was a resident of Wuhan-the city where the Coronavirus originated. She reportedly had flu-like symptoms on January 10 before being admitted to hospital on Jan 12. After nearly two weeks under medical care, she was released.
Homeopathy effective in prevention of novel coronavirus infections, says AYUSH ministry
The state-owned Beijing Daily Newspaper reported that Chen demonstrated significant improvements in her respiratory system following pulmonary CT scans and two independent blood tests found the patient free from the Coronavirus, as reported on Sunday (Jan 26).
According to a recent reports, it claims that Chinese doctors are indicating that trial runs with an HIV wonder drug have ""somewhat successfully"" stopped the spread of the disease to cells.
Three Beijing hospitals began administering lopinavir/itonavir - two antiretroviral drugs used in combination to treat HIV - to patients suffering from the coronavirus. Major research in the past claimed that the antiviral drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS, could be used to treat SARS.
The study also concluded that 'Nelfinavir could decrease the production of virus from cells'.
The death rate from the new coronavirus is not yet known, as more fatalities will likely be reported. Most patients who have died are above 60 and had pre-existing conditions, according to reports from local authorities.
The coronavirus can be passed between humans through close contact, Chinese medical experts say. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days, Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said.
Ten to 14 days is a sound period for isolation and observation. When the incubation period ends, those who fall sick will get timely treatment and those who do not will be just fine.

Epidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017.

116,116,"THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) on Monday, February 10, to investigate and arrest those spreading fake news about the novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
In a statement, DILG Secretary Eduardo Ao those spreading false information the new virus must be arrested, ""because their acts are inimical to the interest of the general public.""
He warned that the PNP would not hesitate to put behind bars all individuals or groups who are guilty of spreading false information on the 2019-nCoV on social media.
""Freedom of expression has limitations, especially when its exercise threatens the welfare of the public. We must put an end to fake news on social media. Kaya sa mga sinasadyang magpakalat ng fake news, stop now before we lock you up,"" Ao warned.
DILG spokesperson and Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said the DILG itself was a victim of fake news when an infographic allegedly coming from the agency was created and distributed last Friday, February 7, alleging that the DILG has decided to place on mandatory quarantine all travelers from 23 countries who have confirmed nCoV cases.
The unauthorized and patently illegal infographic went viral and caused panic among travelers who wanted to cancel their travel plans because of the misrepresentation of these people. It has become absurd and worrisome, he said.
Again, we urge the public to trust only official sources of information and to verify first before sharing. Think first before you click, he added.
He said the PNP's Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG), which investigates crimes using Information and Communications Technology (ICT), is capable of tracing and tracking fake news perpetrators on the Internet. It is currently verifying six suspected fake news posts on the coronavirus on social media.
""The PNP-ACG is working hard to detect the whereabouts of these law offenders. We expect arrests to be made soon,"" said Malaya.
He said Article 154 on the ""Unlawful Use of Means of Publication and Unlawful Utterances"" of the Revised Penal Code punishes perpetrators of fake news. The same provision penalizes a person who causes the publication of any false news which may endanger the public order, or cause damage to the interest or credit of the State.
Violators face imprisonment of one to six months and a fine ranging from P40,000 to P200,000. They could also be punished under the Republic Act 10175, otherwise known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.
""These laws are created for a reason -- to punish law offenders,"" said Malaya. ",FAKE,TRUE
117,117,"On 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The declaration followed a meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak in the Peoples Republic of China, with exportations to other countries. It is considered that the 2019-nCoV outbreak has met the conditions for a WHO Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [1] .
The World Customs Organization (WCO) has been closely monitoring recent developments regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Following the 30 January meeting of the Emergency Committee, the WCO has been liaising with the WHO to ensure WCO Members with public health and safety responsibilities are properly informed about the situation and are involved in national response strategies.
At the level of borders, many WCO Members play an important role in national response strategies to mitigate epidemic-related public health and safety risks. Customs administrations are often countriesfirst and last lines of defence, and Customs officers are among the first government authorities to meet travellers and crew members on board arriving vessels, aircraft, and other types of transport. In this context, it is of utmost importance that Customs administrations with health and safety responsibilities are adequately integrated as part of the preparedness and preresponse mechanisms.
The WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. Members are invited to consult the Updated WHO advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV issued on 27 January 2020.
The WCO will keep a close watch on the 2019-nCoV outbreak and the associated travel- and trade-related developments in this regard.
[1] The term public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is defined in the International Health Regulations as an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response. This definition implies a situation that is: i) serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; ii) carries implications for public health beyond the affected States national border; and iii) may require immediate international action.",FAKE,TRUE
118,118,"Country beefs up preparedness as 2019-nCoV draws closer Tshering Palden
Bhutanese have little to worry in terms of preparedness for prevention and response to a coronavirus outbreak in the country, health officials say.
But the best option is to follow the preventive measures and be safe, health secretary Dr Ugen Dophu said.
He said that the ministry has placed adequate measures in terms of both screening and response in case of an outbreak.
Health officials at a press briefing yesterday said that screening is underway at all the entry points in the southern dzongkhags and daily reports are filed. Health officials from the ministry recently inspected the sites to evaluate the level of preparedness.
Health officials said that they would continue to monitor the preparedness and response status at all the entry points.
Health Minister Dechen Wangmo said, The ministry is preparing for the worst situation of the nCoV outbreak.
She said should it be necessary, resources would be mobilised from traditional development partners, World Health Organisation, and UNICEF.
WHO assessment says that the region is at a high risk of getting infected while China remains at very high risk.
The minister said that Tourism Council of Bhutan refunds the royalty paid by tourists who are cancelling their visits and Drukair is refunding their airfare. Usually those tourists dont get refund. These agencies are making the exception out of goodwill because of the situation, lyonpo said.
Lyonpo Dechen Wangmo also thanked the monastic community spearheaded by the Central Monastic Body for the continuous prayers and rituals conducted to abate the risks of the disease.
According to WHO, no new country reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 48 hours.
Head of Royal Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sonam Wangchuk, said the centre is fully equipped and have resources enough to carry out tests for 40 individuals at a time.
An international tourist in Bumthang who was suspected to be infected with the virus was confirmed to be negative.
Infrastructure Preparedness
The old Mother and Child Health Unit at JDWNRH has been identified as the isolation facility in Thimphu. The facility has 20 beds for isolation and five critical care units.
Two isolation rooms have been identified at Paro hospital, eight in Phuentsholing hospital, four in Samtse hospital, and another eight in Samdrupjongkhar hospital. Gelephu regional referral hospital has 10 isolation rooms and four critical care units.
The Medical Supply Distribution Division in Phuentsholing dispatched five oxygen flow meters, 1,300 N95 masks to JDWNRH, and 1,000 disposable face masks, 500 N95 masks, chlorine, intravenous cannula and intravenous drip sets to Paro hospital on January 31.
In addition, the Department of Medical Supplies and Health Infrastructure have moved four beds, two D type oxygen cylinders and two ventilators from Wangduephodrang hospital to JDWNRH.
Two oxygen flow meters and two electric suction machines have been moved from Punakha hospital, and a portable ventilator have been mobilised from Gelephu hospital and shifted to the national referral hospital.
The ministry will also obtain two thermal scanners to be placed in Phuentsholing and one on standby in Paro airport for mass screening within the week.
The ministry has also placed orders for equipment, infection control consumables and personal protective equipment worth Nu 18.68 million out of which 50 percent of the consignment has already reached the ministry and remaining will arrive this week.
The National Disaster Committee chaired by Prime Minister has been activated, the National Preparedness Plan has been developed, distributed and is now fully implemented by the health centres, mainly at the points of entry.
The Royal Bhutan Police, Immigration officials and Desuups have joined the health workers in screening the public at the points of entry.
Technical advisory group (TAG) for nCoV has been formed which meets regularly to provide recommendations to the health ministry to ensure evidence-based decision making through situation analysis, risk assessment and literature review by the TAG.
The Health Emergency Management Committee meets every day to coordinate the national interventions in regard to any health-related emergency is coordinated by the committee. The committee will meet every day to update on the situation of 2019-nCoV.
Sensitisation on current situations of 2019nCoV and precautionary measures for tour operators, journalists, parliamentarians and monastic body has also been carried out.
Health minister Dechen Wangmo said that the government has not really explored the option of cancelling international flights to and from affected areas as per WHOs recommendations on international travel.
An advisory from the ministry states that reports circulated on social media of outbreaks in nearby areas of Bihar, Assam, and Siliguri were false.
Treat the Ministry of Healths website and social media handles as the single source of information, health secretary Dr Ugen Dophu said.
Other ministries have issued notifications to postpone or cancel any international meetings or conference.
Officials said that since India had reported confirmed cases, there was a risk of missing the screening due to porous borders.
The 2019-nCoV is currently without antivirals (medicines) or vaccine, and asymptomatic cases are reported to be the source of infection with an incubation period of 2-10 days.
There have been reported cases in the region like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand and Nepal where Bhutanese travel for business and pilgrimage purposes.
Thats why Bhutanese should not travel unless absolutely necessary, health secretary, Dr Ugen Dophu said.

120,120,"In the past week China launched a battle against an epidemic of a new coronavirus which emerged in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. There are now more than 4,500 cases of the infection reported in China and about 50 abroad , none of them in Belgium. France has reported three cases and Germany one case. So far, 106 people have died, all of them in China , 100 in Hubei province and 6 in other cities in China. There are also more than 7,000 suspected cases. But some research suggests there may be 44,000 people infected in Wuhan. Several countries, including the U.S. and Japan, are preparing to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The Chinese government took drastic measures to limit the spread of the epidemic. On January 23, Wuhan  a city of 11 million inhabitants and about 3 million migrants  was put in lockdown . All transport  subways, buses, trains  has been suspended. Private cars are no longer permitted to be driven on the streets without a special permit. Everybody venturing in public is required to wear a face mask. To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science, Gauden Galea, the World Health Organizations Representative in China, told the Associated Press in an interview at the WHOs Beijing office. It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.
Air traffic in Hubei province has also been suspended and the borders with other provinces largely sealed. In Beijing, Shanghai and other cities long-distance bus services have been canceled. About 18 cities in China with a total population of 56 million people are under lockdown with all transport in and out of the cities and also within the cities suspended to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus epidemic.
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has set up a special leading group  headed by Premier Li Keqiang  to direct the fight against the epidemic. Premier Li visited Wuhan in the past days. Two special hospitals with 1,300 and 1,000 beds are being build in record time to care for victims of the epidemic. They are expected to be put into service by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) on February 4. More than 4,000 medical personnel have arrived in Hubei from all over China to assist in local hospitals. Producers of protective gear, such as suits and gloves, have been ordered to keep on producing through the Spring Festival holiday to ensure sufficient supplies. Practically all activities to celebrate the Chinese New Year have been canceled and tourist spots  including the Forbidden City and the Great Wall in Beijing  have been closed to the public.
On 31 December 2019, Chinese authorities alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus called 2019-nCoV . The new strain was subsequently isolated from a patient on 7 January 2020. On 21 January, the WHO suggested there was possible sustained human-to-human transmission. Most cases from the initial cluster had links to the Huanan South China Seafood Market were live wild animals were sold. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown, but scientists have pointed to fruit bats and snakes.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus held meetings in Beijing with Chinese health authorities on January 27, but the organization has so far not declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), however, have upgraded their travel warning to Level 3  the highest warning level  which means they advise to avoid all unnecessary travel to China, as the outbreak is of high risk to travelers and no precautions are available to protect against the identified increased risk.
Compared to the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 , the 2019-nCoV virus seems to be spreading faster, but the mortality rate is lower. While SARS killed 9.6% of those infected  774 of 8,098 cases worldwide  the mortality rate in mainland China is now 2.4% and in Hubei province 3.7%. It took almost four months for SARS to spread to 1,000 people, but the Wuhan coronavirus has infected more than 1,200 people in just 25 days. In the case of SARS it took four months for authorities to implement the first quarantine measures; this time it took only 23 days, and the measures were much more drastic.
At a conservative estimate, the scale of infection may eventually be 10 times higher than SARS, Guan Yi, Virology Professor at the University of Hong Kong, told Caixin. Guan Yi is also Director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases and was on the team that first identified SARS. He recently visited Wuhan to investigate the coronavirus outbreak. Ive experienced so much and I never felt scared. Most of them are controllable. But this time Im afraid, he said.
According to Chinas National Health Commission (NHC), respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission , but the virus can also be transmitted through close contact. It added that based on current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period is generally 3 to 7 days, with the longest no more than 14 days.
So far there is no vaccine or cure , and this could still take several months to develop. Scientists at several universities and institutes in the U.S. and China, including the University of Texas and Shanghais Fudan University  and also at the KUL in Leuven  are working to develop a vaccine for the virus. An initial study shows the elderly may more easily become infected, while minors are less sensitive to it, according to Gao Fu, Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. To minimize the risk of infection, quarantine is the most drastic measure. Attention to personal hygiene is very important, including wearing a face mask and gloves when going outside, frequently washing hands, and also avoiding touching the eyes and mouth.
Concerns are also mounting about the economic toll from the outbreak as Wuhan is a major transport hub, also called the thoroughfare of China and a major engine of economic growth. Major car and steel producers are located in the city. Wuhans GDP growth was 7.8% in 2019, 1.7 percentage points higher than the national average. The economic impact for China  and potentially elsewhere  will be significant if the virus continues to spread, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said in a report. The virus could shave between 0.5 to 1 percentage point of Chinas gross domestic product growth (GDP) this year against a baseline forecast of 5.9%, the EIU said. More than 300 of the worlds top 500 companies have a presence in the city.
The China-focused research group Plenum predicted that the effects of disease control policies could see economic growth slow by as much as four percentage points in the first quarter . The government has decided to extend the New Year public holiday by three days till February 2. The transport sector is poised to see huge losses, Plenum said, noting that the volume of airline and railway transport declined by 40% year-on-year on the first day of the Lunar New Year. If that decline extends for the week, the two transit industries will lose 6.4% of annual revenue, or CNY64 billion, the South China Morning Post reports.",FAKE,FAKE

NTS Notes: The first picture alone in Aangirfan's article is PRICELESS...
NTS Notes: Yes, readers, here we have the public believing that people carrying the 'Coronavirus 2019-nCoV"" so called ""deadly"" virus are being bussed to a facility where they are to be quarantined, and that picture shows a person with a full blown Hazmat suit on, while the BUS DRIVER is wearing nothing at all to protect him from the 'virus'.... That alone shows that someone who wanted the propaganda that this virus was 'deadly' to be pushed into the minds of gullible people blew it big time..
And we have the same in that ludicrous picture from supposedly Dallas Fort Worth International Airport back in 2014 in that fraudulent ""Ebola Virus"" scare, with everyone is wearing a ""hazmat"" suit as well, but they again blew it by leaving one person with the clipboard WITHOUT a suit to be seen! Again, that clearly shows that event was so staged and so phoney!
Aangirfan does present some interesting information indeed, and once again he/she takes a swipe at that ludicrous ""Novichok"" scare in the UK from 2018 that was 100% a scam that the British people sadly fell for.... Sadly, to this day, the British people still think that actually did happen as the liars in their own government continue to promote!
The facts are that the liars in the Jew spew media and those involved to sell the world into the false belief that this 'coronavirus' is 'deadly' have failed miserably.... BUT as I have said many times, these liars and criminals know that the general public is so easily manipulated and that they could throw anything out there and gullible people will fall for the lies each and every time...",TRUE,TRUE
122,122,"IFSW member The Chinese Association of Social Workers has been actively engaged in the fight against the coronavirus. Their International Officer, Yang Aibing correspond with IFSW saying: As soon as the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was announced, CASW started a series of actions, for example, we released the National Social Workers proposal to call on social workers for personal protection, and fulfilling the mission of the industry to support the prevention and control of the epidemic. CASW also published The Social Worker Support Manual on the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia Caused by the Coronavirus Infection, which proposes the basic working principles and methods to social workers during the prevention and control period. Meanwhile, CASW has launched an online training course to Fight Against the Epidemic based on the Community  Series of Social Work Courses, to provide professional guidance and psychological support for social workers to effectively participate in the prevention and control of the virus. Since the outbreak, CASW has been working closely with member organizations to launch online Mental Health Assistance Campaign Against New Coronary Pneumonia to provide online psychological counselling to the public who are impacted. The CASW branches in provinces have also actively guided local social workers to participate in the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic and launching their own guidelines on the prevention and control of the epidemic. At present, the main ways for social workers to participate in epidemic prevention and control are online psychological counselling, offline community screening and education. Wuhan Association of Social Workers recruited social workers to provide volunteer services and medical staff to provide psychological counselling and relief services, community workers psychosocial support and backup support services such as home quarantine. Wuhan has also established the 2 + 3 online community anti-virus mode, which means 2 professional workers (1 social worker, 1 community worker) + 3 volunteers (medical worker, psychological worker, assistant), working with mobile internet tools to help local governments to implement home from home home screening and early intervention; Shanghai Social Workers Association launched the Epidemic Fighting  Shanghai Social Workers Service Group, Guangzhou Social Workers Association launched Guangzhou Social Workers Cotton Sponge Guard Hotline, they are providing community residents with advisory services on new pneumonia prevention knowledge and epidemic prevention and control policies; also providing online counselling and support services for confirmed or suspected patients, such as psychological assistance, emotional support and medical assistance; providing epidemic prevention assistance, life assistance and other support services to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community; collecting and sorting out real and feasible epidemic prevention and control knowledge and information; providing relevant information counselling services for community residents, and online services such as information counselling, knowledge promotion, psychological counselling and emotional counselling for residents in psychological panic and pressure. Chengdu social workers are going door to door in the community to check the epidemic, coordinating medical supplies, etc. We list here the activities of only a few major provinces. In fact, social workers in every province are actively involved, because this is one thing that concerns all of us. We believe that everyones efforts are the greatest support for prevention and to contain the spread of the epidemic. We hope we can overcome this difficulty as soon as we could. IFSW Asia-Pacific Regional President Rose Henderson commented, I congratulate the CASW taking such a positive and constructive leadership in responding to this crisis. Further, I am sure that the guiding documents, training and response work CASW have developed would be very valuable to share with social work colleagues regionally and globally as the virus spreads across borders. I encourage CASW and other colleagues across our region also now involved in responding to this virus to continue to share your wisdom and resources as we collectively work with the increasing prevalence of this illness. I commend the work of social workers in China and acknowledge the huge challenges of being both impacted personally at the same time as you are responding to the needs of your communities.
Rory Truell, IFSW Secretary-General added, The profession of social work has been an essential pillar in the prevention of the spread of diseases. Records dating back from the Victorian slums in England and the USA, through to current examples, show that the profession has successfully worked with virus control throughout the world. The fight against HIV/AIDS, SARS and Ebola have all needed more than a medical response and the social work role in providing community education, support, information and reducing panic have been key factors in the control or elimination of diseases resulting in saving millions of lives. The lessons being learnt in China today highlight the need for every government to build and strengthen social work services. Communities supported with knowledge and information on how to act is essential for our futures.

123,123,"Investigate Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) per CDC Guidelines with COPAN's FLOQSwab Kit
On January 30th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) held its second meeting in Geneva of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). During the meeting the committee agreed that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and that the PHEIC  should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success 1  A coordinated global effort is critical in order to improve worldwide preparedness and successful measures to contain this outbreak in other regions of the world.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have released an Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) recommending [c]ollection of three specimen types, lower respiratory, upper respiratory and serum specimens for testing from patients under investigation (PUI) of the novel coronavirus 2
For upper respiratory specimens, the CDC is recommending nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates, nasal aspirates or to collect both a nasopharyngeal swab AND an oropharyngeal swab made of synthetic fiber with plastic applicators. Once the specimens are collected, it is recommended that the swabs are placed in 2-3 ml of viral transport media 3
One of COPANs kits pairs 3mL of UTM  universal viral transport medium and two FLOQSwabs  : one minitip synthetic flocked swab ideal for nasopharyngeal samples and one regular synthetic flocked swab ideal of oropharyngeal samples. COPAN manufactures private label UTM  for Becton Dickinson (as UVT), Diagnostic Hybrids-Quidel, and Hardy Diagnostics (as Healthlink UTM  ).
The open structure of COPAN FLOQSwabs  acts like a soft brush that efficiently dislodges and collects cells and mucus then releases the sample immediately when immersed in viral transport medium. COPAN flocked swabs are easy to use and less invasive causing minimal discomfort for the patient when compared to nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates or nasal washes.",FAKE,TRUE
124,124,"The Department of Education (DepEd) on Friday confirmed that the scheduled early registration for school year (SY) 2020-2021 will take place amid the novel coronavirus (nCoV) threat.
Department of Education (MANILA BULLETIN)
Undersecretary for Planning and Field Operations Jesus Mateo told the Manila Bulletin that the scheduled early registration will push through as planned, although, he added, We have to take precautionary measures.
Early registration is an annual activity led by DepEd to ensure that all new entrants for kindergarten and Grades 1, 7, and 11 in public and private elementary and secondary schools nationwide are listed months before the opening of the new school year.
DepEd is set to open its early registration desks on Feb. 1, Saturday to March 6, Friday. The activity was originally scheduled for Jan. 25 to Feb. 28, but this was moved to the current dates because Jan. 25 was the Lunar New Year, a public non-working holiday.
In his Jan. 24 memorandum, DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Del Pascua alerted all regional directors, schools division superintendents, principals or school heads, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, learners and all others concerned to take precautionary measures against the possible spread of the virus.
Pascua strictly advised everyone to take precautionary measures such as making hand washing a habit, always covering ones mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with people who show signs of respiratory illness, drinking plenty of water, ensuring food is cooked properly, and consulting a health facility if symptoms of cough and colds persist.
In its latest statement on nCoV, DepEd also expressed readiness to contribute to the overall Philippine government efforts for the management of this public health situation following the first confirmed case of the deadly virus in the country.
Eligibility and requirements
DepEd said for kindergarten, only those who are five years old on or before Aug. 31, 2020 are eligible; for Grade 1, participants should have completed kinder or passed the Philippine Education Placement Test (PEPT) Passer for kinder level; those six years old or older by Aug. 31, 2020 but not kinder completers, who are assessed Grade 1-ready as per ECD checklist, may also pre-register.
For Grade 7, they must be Grade 6 completers or PEPT Passers for Grade 6, or Alternative Learning System Accreditation and Equivalency (ALS-A&E) elementary passers; and for Grade 11, those who will pre-register must be Grade 10 completers or PEPT Passers for Grade 10 or ALS-A&E secondary passers.
For kindergarten and Grade 1, a Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) or National Statistics Authority (NSO) birth certificate must be submitted. In case of its absence, a Local Civil Registrar (LCR) birth certificate, baptismal, or barangay certificate can be submitted.
Learners must also accomplish the Basic Education Enrolment Form during early registration, DepEd said. The early registration policy, DepEd noted, upholds the right of all school-aged learners to enroll and be equally provided with quality, accessible, relevant, and liberating basic education.
Meanwhile, DepEd said that the schedule of the early registration in Taal Volcano-affected areas will be flexible. Earlier, DepEd Region IV-A Wilfredo Cabral requested for the extension date of the early registration to accommodate and account [for] all those displaced by the eruption.
DepEd has also directed that the documentary requirements in these affected schools be waived subject for submission once available.
The latest DepEd data showed that 548,672 learners in 1,010 affected schools under four divisions in Region IV-A are affected by the suspension of classes at all levels since Jan. 13. DepEd noted that 10, 791 learners are currently staying in 224 schools which serve as evacuation centers. A total of 19, 714 DepEd personnel remain affected by Taals unrest to date.",FAKE,TRUE

Speaking in a press brief at the White House, Trump said, ""The scientists at Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have released a report offering how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces.""
""The findings confirm the virus survives better in colder, drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments,"" he added.

The remaining samples are in transit or are being processed at the CDC for testing, Nancy Messonnier, MD , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the briefing.
The genetic sequence for all five viruses detected in the United States to date has been uploaded to the CDC website, she said. We are working quickly through the process to get the CDC-developed test into the hands of public health partners in the U.S. and internationally.
Dr. Messonnier reported that the CDC is expanding screening efforts to U.S. ports of entry that house CDC quarantine stations. Also, in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency is expanding distribution of travel health education materials to all travelers from China.
The good news here is that, despite an aggressive public health investigation to find new cases [of 2019-nCoV], we have not, she said. The situation in China is concerning, however, we are looking hard here in the U.S. We will continue to be proactive. I still expect that we will find additional cases.

We have taken every precaution to ensure their safety while also continuing to protect the health of our nation and the people around them, Dr. Messonnier said.
All 195 passengers have been screened, monitored, and evaluated by medical personnel every step of the way, including before takeoff, during the flight, during a refueling stop in Alaska, and again upon landing at March Air Reserve Force Base on Jan. 28. All 195 patients are without the symptoms of the novel coronavirus, and all have been assigned living quarters at the Air Force base, Dr. Messonnier said.
The CDC has launched a second stage of further screening and information gathering from the passengers, who will be offered testing as part of a thorough risk assessment.
I understand that many people in the U.S. are worried about this virus and whether it will affect them, Dr. Messonnier said. Outbreaks like this are always concerning, particularly when a new virus is emerging. But we are well prepared and working closely with federal, state, and local partners to protect our communities and others nationwide from this public health threat.

Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.",FAKE,TRUE

1. All previous coronaviruses have transmitted through droplets
2. So, it would be unusual if this new pathogen was different.
3. The new coronavirus is behaving much like SARS
4. Both are zoonotic, started in animals before jumping to humans, and both appear to have started in bats.
5. The pair also transmit from human to human and have a long incubation periodup to 14 days for the Wuhan coronavirus, compared to about two for influenzawhich means that people might be sick and transmitting the disease before symptoms show up.
6. Follow CDC guidance for infectious diseases when youre on an airplane: Washing your hands with regular soap or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after touching any surface especially since theres evidence that coronaviruses last longer on surfaces than other illnesses, around three to 12 hours. Y ou should also avoid touching your face and contact with coughing passengers by whatever means possible.
7. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on a person or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face you can become infected as well. These droplets are not affected by air flowing through a space, but instead fall close to where they originate.
8. The hospitals guidelines for influenza define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer.
9. Respiratory illnesses can also be spread through the surfaces upon which the droplets land, like airplane seats and tray tables.
10. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted through the air in tiny, dry particles known as aerosols. But, its not the major mechanism of transmission. Viruses would rather be moist, and many fades from being infectious if left dry for too long.
11. The WHO defines contact with an infected person as being seated within two rows of one another. But people dont just sit during flights, particularly ones lasting longer than a few hours. They visit the bathroom, stretch their legs, and grab items from the overhead bins. 38 percent of passengers leave their seats once and 24 percent more than once. Another 38 percent of people stay in their seats throughout the entire flight.
12. The passengers are least likely to get up were in window seats: only 43 percent moved around as opposed to 80 percent of people seated on the aisle. Window seat passengers have far fewer close encounters than people in other seats, averaging 12 contacts compared to the 58 and 64 respective contacts for passengers in middle and aisle seats.
13. Choosing a window seat and staying put clearly lowers your likelihood of encountering an infectious disease.
14. Passengers in middle and aisle seatseven those that are within the WHOs two-seat range also have a low probability of getting infected. Because most contact people have on airplanes is relatively short.
15. But if the crew member is infected as they spend much more time walking down the aisle and interacting with passengers, they are more likely to have additionaland longerclose encounters.
16. A sick crew member has a probability of infecting 4.6 passengers; thus it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill. Whats worse, the coronavirus or influenza? The reproduction numberR0 or r naughtsimply refers to the number of additional people that an infected person typically makes sick. Transmissibility rate for the new coronavirus ranging from 2.0 to 3.1 people. Thats higher than influenza1.3 to 1.8but like SARS, which has a basic reproduction number in the 2 to 4 range. So, coronaviruses are slightly more prone to spreading between people. The case-fatality ratioor death-to-case ratiois the number of people killed by disease divided by the number of people who catch it. Seasonal influenza, despite being considered a global scourge, technically kills a relatively small proportion of its cases, with a case-fatality ratio around 0.1 percent. SARS had a case-fatality rate of 10 percent and the rate for the new coronavirus is currently near 3 percent, which is on par with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Unlike with influenza, the entire human population is susceptible to this coronavirus because no one has ever had it beforeand there is no specific treatment like a vaccine.
Public are dependent on infection control, such as washing hands, reducing contact with afflicted individuals and quarantines.
