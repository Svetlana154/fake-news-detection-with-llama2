2,2,"Dr. Jane Orient: The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially. Biological threats proliferateuntil they run out of susceptible victims. Published on January 31, 2020 Author World Health Organization
Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop if-it-bleeds-it-leads press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silenceuntil panic breaks out.
The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentiallyin the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferateuntil they run out of susceptible victims.
In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .
As in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.
Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and canceling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of confirmed caseswhile countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.
The New England Journal of Medicine writes , Another Decade, Another Coronavirus. This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.
This virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effectiveespecially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.The Peoples Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.
A report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread .
The corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .
In a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masksregular surgical masks are probably of little help.
Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.
Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their familys and their communitys survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.
For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly. Leave a Reply",TRUE,TRUE

4,4,"Certainly a topic which none would like to read and get to know more details .. sad it is an epidemic of mammoth proportions !
An epidemic (from Greek epi ""upon or above"") is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less. Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population. Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded. The epidemic triangle is essentially an equation. It posits that every outbreak, regardless of its specific traits, is dependent on the interplay between three factors: the pathogen (the agent causing infection), the host (the organism at risk of infection) and the environment (the setting where the infections occur). Every single epidemic  be it the flu, cholera or even behavioral epidemics like drunken driving  is the result of a dynamic shift in one of these points of the epidemic triangle, which then causes a domino effect leading to a sudden explosion of new cases.
""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague, that is, that he is named ""Montague"". The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are.
The whole World is concerned and talking about a deadly virus, derived from that word meaning crown or halo, which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles (virions): they have a fringe reminiscent of a crown or of a solar corona. A corona (meaning 'crown' in Latin derived from Ancient Greek) is an aura of plasma that surrounds the Sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into outer space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, but it is also observable with a coronagraph. Light from the corona comes from three primary sources, from the same volume of space.
The news is the coronavirus causing a deadly outbreak in China has been named COVID-19 , the World Health Organization has announced. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the global body, announced the new name at a conference in Geneva this afternoon. It comes almost six weeks after the virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China, in late December. Since then it has infected more than 43,000 people and killed 1,018. The virus, which has had various names from simply coronavirus to Wuhan coronavirus, Chinese coronavirus or even snake flu, needs its own moniker because it is just one type of coronavirus.
The word refers to a group of viruses which contains those that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Coronaviruses are so named because their structure has jagged edges which look like a royal crown  corona is crown in Latin. 'Under agreed guidelines between WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. 'Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks. A name had been expected since scientists at the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) last week announced they had decided on one.
The name COVID-19 has now been approved and will hopefully be used by 'everybody', the WHO said, to avoid stigmatising or confusing names. It also allows for it to refer to the 'entire spectrum of clinical conditions' which the virus can cause, said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, meaning it is not specific to certain symptoms. SARS and MERS on the other hand, have names which only refer to the effects they have on the lungs  the respiratory effects  and not anything else. The World Health Organization has an international set of rules which scientists must follow when proposing new names for a virus. They must not contain references to certain places in the world, communities, human names or animals because they may cause a 'backlash' or racism. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is listed as a bad example, as well as Spanish Flu, Lyme disease, Japanese encephalitis, swine flu, bird flu and monkey pox. Other words to avoid are ones which might induce fear, such as 'unknown', 'death', 'fatal' or 'epidemic'.
So that deadly epidemic that has caused death of more than 1000 people in China has a name. Streets wear a deserted look in Beijing, a city home to more than 20million people, as people stay home out of fear of catching the virus. Hazmat-wearing laboratory technicians are pictured talking to residents of the city of Linyi, where they are investigating the virus. The danger when you don't have an official name is that people start using terms like China Virus, and that can create a backlash against certain populations.
Health bulletins state that someone who is infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze. At least 1,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 43,000 have been infected in at least 28 countries and regions. But some media predict the true number of people with the disease could be 100,000, or even as high as 350,000 in Wuhan alone, as they warn it may kill as many as two in 100 cases.
A coronavirus (now COVID 19) is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. Scientists state that Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. According to scientists, the virus has almost certainly come from bats. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in the city, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.
Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take long time and huge amounts of money. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.

Dr. Boyle has come across information suggesting that Chinese scientists may have stolen this virus out of a lab in Winnipeg, where Canada tests a lot of their biological warfare weapons. He believes the virus then leaked out of a lab in Wuhan (BSL-4), in the wake of reports of previous reports of leaks coming out of this specific lab. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.
A CBC news report maintains that, while there is truth that the lab in Winnipeg had some policy breaches with researchers who were Chinese nationals, it is not confirmed that this involved stealing the virus and bringing it to Wuhan.

10,10,"China praised for reaction to disease outbreak
Top officials from the World Health Organization, or WHO, said on Thursday that the new coronavirus that has affected hundreds of people globally is not yet a global health emergency.
The briefing came after the WHO Emergency Committee spent a second day discussing the topic, but the committee concluded that it is still too early to declare a public health emergency of international concern, given the restrictive and binary nature of the outbreak.
As it had been on Wednesday, the committee remained divided over the decision to determine the status of the outbreak.
""I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today,"" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
""Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. WHO's risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally.""
The WHO said it would continue to review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the new coronavirus outbreak, the extent of person-to-person transmission, and the screening efforts in other provinces of China.
According to the committee, the new virus, which is now named 2019-nCoV, can cause severe disease, and can kill, although for most people, it causes milder symptoms. It is understood that among those infected, one-quarter of patients have experienced severe disease. Most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that had weakened their immune systems.
There is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients, WHO officials said. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that might happen.
As of yet, there is little information regarding the original source of this virus, its clinical features, its severity and how easily it spreads.
For the moment, the WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade but advises exit screening at airports as part of a comprehensive set of containment measures.

As Delta, American and United Airlines suspend all flights to China, KFBB decided to ask the Great Falls International Airport how staff are preparing for any potential pandemics.
As of Friday, the airport is waiting on word from official health and flight departments before making a move, but they do have emergency plans in place for most any situation.
While GFIA Director John Faulkner couldn't talk about the plans in detail out of security and privacy concerns, he said in-flight medical emergencies like chest pains may trigger the plan. In theory, if a passenger shows potential corona virus symptoms , the airport would work with local health authorities to quarantine them, according to Faulkner.
The chance of cases happening in Great Falls is significantly lower than most major hubs like Seattle, but Faulkner said you can't go wrong with a little preparation.
""Bring some chlorox wipes and you know wipe down the tray table. You know if you're going to be travelling on a flight that has entertainment screens, it's a good idea if you're touching the buttons, go ahead and wipe that down, said the airport director. Bring some hand sanitizer so you can sanitize your hands on the flight.""
Faulkner also recommends paying attention to health alerts as you make your travel plans, especially if you want to fly overseas. Corona virus cases have already been confirmed worldwide in the U.S., Canada, China, Southeast Asia and Australia.
If you're just feeling sick for whatever reason, Faulkner said the best thing you can do stay home and reschedule your flight if possible.
