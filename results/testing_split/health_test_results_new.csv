9,9,"For Japan, the last decade exhibited a period of remarkable growth for tourism to Japan. The number of people visiting Japan increased from just 6.2 million people in 2011 to 31.2 million in 2018, which is a faster rate of growth over that period compared to any other major tourism destination. The relaxation of visa requirements, particularly for Chinese citizens, and a drop in the value of the yen made Japan an attractive destination.
However, after years of dramatic growth, Japans tourism numbers plateaued from 2018 to 2019. The stagnation was mainly due to a decline in South Korean visitors. Tourists from other major sources of visitors like China, Taiwan, and the US continued to climb. The drop in South Korean tourists was due to a trade war between Japan and South Korea.
The trade war began in July 2019, with the Japanese government restricting the export of chemical materials to South Korea that are important to the South Korean consumer electronics industry. The tensions between the two countries continued throughout the second half of 2019. In late July, South Koreans started boycotting Japanese products and cancelling visits to Japan. This had a huge impact on Japanese tourism. Japanese tourism to South Korea also dropped down, but to a lesser extent.
Japans tourism industry is not likely to rebound this year even though Tokyo looks forward to receive a boost from hosting the Olympics, due to a new threat amid the continuing trade dispute with South Korea. The corona virus emerging from China, and which has spread to around 30 countries, could crush Japans aim of hosting 40 million visitors in 2020. China, which is the biggest source of tourists to Japan, banned group outward travel in January and flights between Japan and China are sharply down. Hence, Japans tourism industry is likely to suffer.

In the meantime, Deutsche Welle (DW  by Alexander Freund) is reporting on first cases in Europe and Germany and on how Corona virus is it transmitted? What are the symptoms? And which precautionary measures are recommended to stop it spreading? CORONAVIRUS: TIMELINE OF THE DEADLY VIRUS IN CHINA AND WORLDWIDE Pneumonia-like virus hits Wuhan
On December 31, 2019, China notifies the World Health Organization of a string of respiratory infections in the city of Wuhan, home to some 11 million people. The root virus is unknown and disease experts around the world begin working to identify it. The strain is traced to a seafood market in the city, which is quickly shut down. Some 40 people are initially reported to be infected.
How is the virus transmitted?
The new coronavirus can be transmitted between humans, according to Chinese health authorities. It is also adapting and mutating, which could make the virus spread faster and possibly more difficult to treat.
It is not yet clear how infectious the virus is. Although many other coronaviruses are transmitted by coughing and sneezing, there are no indications so far that the virus is transmitted via the respiratory tract.
The first infections were detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan and traced back to a wild animal and fish market, which has now been shut down. The virus might have been transmitted through direct contact between humans and animals, or simply via the air like many germs.
Viruses that can spread between humans and animals cause so-called zoonotic diseases. Such viruses may be transmitted when humans consume meat or animal products  or if such products were insufficiently heated or prepared in an unsanitary environment.
Travelers being screened for corona virus
What are the symptoms?
Patients who have contracted the virus have had fever, shortness of breath and coughing. The virus can also cause pneumonia, an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs and can cause them to fill with fluid or pus. Elderly citizens tend to be more often affected by the virus than younger people.
Since the virus broke out in December last year, it has infected hundreds of people across China. Cases have also been reported in the United States, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
What do we know about the virus?
Experts recently decoded the coronavirus gene sequence, which is also known as 2019-nCoV. Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1960s and their name derives from their crown or halo-like shape. Viruses of this kind are not per se lethal. Sometimes, they also lead to gastrointestinal disorders and diarrhea, in particular. A number of governments have begun screening air passengers from China
But coronaviruses, which are RNA viruses, are also extremely adaptable and genetically diverse. This means they can easily spread between and infect different species. While some coronaviruses can cause the common cold, others can develop into more serious illnesses that lead to difficulty breathing, pneumonia and even death.
In 2002 and 2003, for example, the aggressive SARS-CoV coronavirus led to an epidemic in 30 countries. Worldwide, more than 8,000 people became infected with the virus, about 1,000 died. And in 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula.
Which can be done to stop the outbreak?
Airports around the world  and particularly in China  have introduced fever checks for passengers traveling from China.
Should the outbreak be declared an international public health emergency, that could mean restrictions for international travel, tighter border checks, and setting up special treatment centers as well as quarantine areas.
As always, it is advisable to practice good hygiene and caution, for example by avoiding close contact with individuals suffering from acute respiratory infections, or wild animals or livestock, dead or alive. People should wash their hands regularly, especially after being in direct contact with an infected person. Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1960s and their name derives from their corona-like shape
Currently, neither the WHO nor Germanys Foreign Ministry has issued a travel warning for the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Health experts do not expect this new coronavirus to spread globally. Virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of Hamburgs Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, said no special precautions need to be taken in Germany. In his opinion, the current threat is very low. But he said it is key that the WHO, Robert Koch Institute [the German government's central biomedicine research center] and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control permanently monitor the situation.
How has it been impacting the economy?
Concerns over the virus have sent Asian stock markets tumbling. The memory of the economic damage caused by the SARS epidemic between 2002 and 2003 is still fresh, with people concerned about the impact on the tourism and travel industries as well as limitations to consumer spending.",TRUE,FAKE

25,25,"Last month as the corona virus began to spread, I could hear the rumblings. All this wave of hysteria; whether it was through news sources or people just freaking out.
Yes, many things are upsetting about the virus. Take for example, the limitation one has to go outside and enjoy a sunny day at the park. Or go to a restaurant for ones favourite food. It is an inconvenience, but as I was telling a colleague, I rather you be bored, than infected! dogonews.com
Another factor, the illness is easily transmittable; but one thing is important to recognizea person has a chance of getting it between 0.021 to 0.025%; which means a person has 99.98% chance of recovery. That in itself is a positive inside a country of 1.4 billion people. That is why I love to follow the facts and numbers. Numbers dont lie! Furthermore, I enjoy following the science. Better to follow the facts than become one of those in the desperation of hearsay and the rumour mill.
Important to consider, the respect for life and lives the virus has taken. Dont risk it by being selfish, going outside when there is no need. You could get infected. If that is not a problem for you when solo, then fine, but please consider those around you. Follow the experts suggestions, they know better and these are implemented for a reason. Stay away from crowded areas, wear a mask (Replace it every four to eight hours and try whenever possible to wear an N-95 mask or any mask for that matter), wash your hands constantly, basically practice good hygiene, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. Practical advice. Then why take unnecessary risks to try and challenge the odds.
If youre not sure which advice to follow. Because the internet does have fake news and charlatans out there trying to provoke fear and havoc. My teachers in school taught me always to do research on three reliable/credible news sources and compare. In times like these it is important to use common sense and not desperation.
There are many things to be thankful for
Reason number one: we are alive and kicking. This single statement gives us hope for today, possibly tomorrow and thereafter.
Reason number two: this is not the end of the world. As some people would like to believe, you know, like those who carry posters saying, The end is nay! or believe in Nostradamus . Well ladies and gents, it is not! Dont overreact.
Reason number three: stay positive. Getting down and out depressed wont help you or anybody around you. Being sad or desperate like the virus is contagious. Avoid it. Therefore, stay calm! Stay positive by reading your favourite book, watching your favourite series, doing your favourite exercise. Even when you have cabin fever, avoid it by playing card games, keeping distracted or walking from room to room for distraction. Meditate when you feel desperate, like when you want to scream or cry. Only do the latter as a release and once it doesnt disturb others. We all have our days, but there are more positives in life than negatives. Remember that!
Reason number four: sleep eight-and-half hours. Sleep will help improve your mood. Lack of it will make any person irritable and unhappy. Too much of it, might get you depressed.
Reason number five: try to build a routine to help improve your health and feelings about the situation. If you have food around, internet, youre staying communicated, theres a roof over your head, a warm bed to sleep inhey, youre luckier than 70% of the people around the world who dont have that and live in poverty.
To conclude, there are things about the virus and how it was handled since its conception we may not agree with. There is no time for that, there is the present. This is a time for unity-solidarity and to look at the bright side, how it has been contained or quarantined to avoid further spreading. With this in mind, chin-up!

But because of the spreading corona virus, Russia has recently closed its border with China , completely stopped the train traffic between the two countries and most of the air traffic.

Nevertheless, there is no longer a province in China that is not affected. The John Hopkins University keeps the visitors of its website up to date on the spread of the virus and the number of casualties.
Journalist Ian Rogers is now spreading on Twitter that the Chinese Chess Federation has asked Ding Liren and Wang Hao to arrive 14 days before the tournament starts in order to serve the virus incubation period. The World Chess Federation contradicted this: Currently all scenarios would be considered that could make it difficult or impossible for the two Chinese to enter Russia in order to be able to solve them. FIDE claims it has not asked the two players to arrive early.
Not yet, at least.
It is still unclear where the request to the two players came from. FIDE states that none other than their legal advisor is in contact with Ding Liren and Wang Hao so that their candidate contracts will be closed as soon as possible. Rogers said the Chinese Association only forwarded the request, but did not identify its origin.

In any case, according to Rogers, both players are under the impression that they should be present in Yekaterinburg two weeks before the tournament starts. Which would be quite a handicap. Hi Ian:This is the exact content of the email sent to the players by our legal advisor, which differs slightly from what you state in your email: 
The acute question is whether the two World Championship candidates have a Russia visa that is valid for the weeks of the candidate tournament.

The increase in the number of fatalities  from 26 on Friday to 41  was the sharpest single-day spike in deaths due to the previously unseen virus that is believed to have begun spreading late December from a seafood market in Wuhan. Around 250 Indians are still in Wuhan, people aware of the situation said, adding that hundreds more are believed to have headed back to India in the past two weeks for the Lunar New Year holidays. The remaining Indians in the city mostly comprise students and around 50 working individuals, these people added. India has requested the Chinese foreign ministry as well as local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for Indians to leave, news agency PTI quoted sources as saying. It is not clear how and when India plans to evacuate its citizens if approval is granted. The United States was reported to have begun arranging for a charter flight, a Boeing 767 jet that can carry around 230 passengers, to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Washington was given approval for the operation from the Chinese foreign ministry, the report added. Russia too was consulting with China while France was setting up a bus service to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, according to media reports quoting the Russian embassy and the French consulate. In India, a top adviser of the Prime Minister met senior bureaucrats from across several ministries to review response mechanisms if the contagion spreads to India, while authorities also issued a fresh travel advisory urging people to avoid going to China unless essential. There are at least 11 people who have been isolated with symptoms similar to an nCoV infection  with dozens more being monitored over phone after they travelled to Chinese cities. The virus also expanded its footprint as Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday. Late on Friday, Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europes first infection. Hong Kong also declared an emergency, scrapping celebrations and restricting links to mainland China. Apart from these, positive cases of coronavirus have been reported from South Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and as far as the US. Authorities in Wuhan said they will build a second hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients, a day after construction began for a 1,000-bed facility scheduled to be completed within ten days. About 450 military medics have also been deployed to help treat patients in the central city. Regions far from the epidemic epicentre, such as Beijing, have also started to clamp down on the flow of people. On Saturday, the countrys capital said it would suspend buses in and out of the city, on top of closing tourist attractions and cancelling large-scale events during the Lunar New Year holiday. As long as we have steadfast confidence, work together, scientific prevention and cures, and precise policies, we will definitely be able to win the battle, Chinese President Xi told a meeting of the elite Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday. The virus has caused global alarm because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).The newly identified strain still has many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases, and shows flu-like symptoms. Particularly at risk are people who are either very young or old and those with a compromised immunity due to other diseases. ",TRUE,TRUE

37,37,"Otero and Crowley County Health Director Rick Ritter is no stranger to preparation for the threat of pandemics in the shape of the corona virus or other threat of mass contagion. Although the threat to Southeast Colorado is minimal at the present time, he cautioned, We live in such a world that somebody could come in to the airport in Denver and be here in three hours.
He has been preparing for pandemic for years now, and although we are only in the monitoring phase now, preparations have been made with medical providers, public health providers, county commissioners and district court staff to deal with a pandemic if it should occur. The steps for non-pharmaceutical intervention include (1) social distancing - dont go out if you dont have to, if there is a communicable disease spreading, (2) isolation - stay home if you are sick, (3) quarantine - if you have been exposed, stay home until you know you are clear (incubation period).
Ritter has been concerned about the corona virus for two reasons and is watching the situation closely, as is the Center for Disease Control, national headquarters in Atlanta, Ga., but branches all over, one in Fort Collins. The virus is a zoonotic, having passed from snakes to humans in China. It has now changed again to allow transmission from human to human. Such viruses, among them SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] and MERS [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome], have proven especially deadly and hard to combat.
The latest from the State Health Department, said Ritter on Tuesday, which I just received, is that the third test in Colorado for Novel Corona Virus is confirmed negative. The current risk for Colorado is low.
However, in a quote from his father, Ritter said, It is better to have something and not need it than to need something and not have it. Therefore, the Otero-Crowley Department of Public Health and Environment has been getting prepared for a pandemic situation for several years now.
Ritter forwards all information he receives regarding the new Corona Virus or any other communicable disease directly to medical providers, the hospital, and all public health facilities such as Valley Wide Clinics and Southeast Health. Our program is pro-active, said Ritter, not retro-active. The department has also staged several emergency drills to prepare communications among first responders and civil authorities. The Otero County Commissioners, first responders, civil authorities and public health providers have taken part in the drills.
A conference with Judicial District 16 is planned to discuss with judges, county administrators, judicial district staff and attorneys, to talk about legal issues which might arise in the event of a pandemic situation.
Things are in place if we need them, said Ritter. What is his advice for the present? Wash your hands for 20 seconds, in between the fingers. If youre sick, stay home!",TRUE,TRUE

40,40,"To develop therapeutics to treat the 2019 novel coronavirus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) will expand an existing collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, New York.
""Emerging infectious diseases can present serious threats to our nation's health security,"" said Rick Bright, Ph.D., deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response and director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) at ASPR. ""Working as public-private partners like we have with Regeneron since 2014, we can move rapidly to respond to new global health threats.""
BARDA and Regeneron now will leverage their partnership agreement to develop multiple monoclonal antibodies that, individually or in combination, could be used to treat this emerging coronavirus, also known as 2019-nCoV .
These monoclonal antibodies are produced by a single clone of cells or a cell line with identical antibody molecules. The antibodies bind to certain proteins of a virus, reducing the ability of the virus to infect human cells. Medicines developed for 2019-nCoV through the expanded BARDA-Regeneron partnership will leverage Regeneron's monoclonal antibody discovery platform called VelocImmune, part of the company's VelociSuite technology.
VelociSuite was used to develop a promising investigational three- antibody therapeutic which was deployed to treat Ebola in the most recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and an investigational two-antibody therapeutic to treat Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The technology shortened multiple aspects of the product development timeline for therapeutics to treat MERS-CoV and Ebola from years to months. The technology helped shorten certain stages of drug development, including the process of antibody discovery and selection, preclinical-scale manufacturing and clinical-scale manufacturing.
In addition to expanded collaboration with Regeneron, BARDA is working with counterparts across the government, including within HHS and with the Department of Defense. The team is reviewing potential vaccines, treatments and diagnostics from across the public and private sectors, particularly products in development for MERS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), to identify promising candidates for development to detect, protect against or treat 2019 nCoV.
To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector that could be used in responding to 2019-nCoV, the U.S. government on Friday launched a single point of entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies relevant to this new virus. Federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed into or beyond non-clinical studies, have established large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, or utilize a platform already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
HHS Secretary Alex Azar declared a nationwide public health emergency January 31 to aid state health departments' efforts to curb the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization identified the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV as a Pandemic Health Emergency of International Concern. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines to protect individuals or FDA-approved medicines to treat individuals who may become ill from 2019-nCoV infections.

The ban was reportedly put into place on Monday and restricts nonessential travel to China by employees. Any employees that do need to travel to the region must get specific approval from Facebook before they go, reports Bloomberg . The outlet also says that Facebook has told employees who are in China or who have just returned home from a trip to China to work from home. The BBC says that more than 100 people have now died from the coronavirus in China, and more than 4,500 are known to be infected across 16 countries worldwide, including in the U.S.
Facebooks decision to ban employee movement to China was probably easier to make than it would be for other tech giants like Apple and Google. Facebook sells its Portal and Oculus devices in China and overseas their development there, but beyond those devices, the social media giant does not have a large footprint in the country. However, Apple and Google, with their myriad devices prototyped and built in the country could see a profound effect on the production of those devices if the two companies decide to follow suit with Facebooks nonessential travel employee ban.

His books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine. Natural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircuss protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles. The exciting part of Dr. Sircuss protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrougha legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the worldDr. Sircuss protocol is entirely legal. With the publication of Dr. Sircuss Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health. Dr. Sircuss approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs.

51,51,"Very few people are talking about it, and even fewer are bothering to object, but by borrowing and spending so much money our politicians are essentially feeding Americas financial future into a wood chipper. 

It took from the founding of our country all the way to 1981 before the U.S. national debt reached one trillion dollars.

Incredibly, we just added more than a trillion dollars to our national debt in less than a month.

On April 5th, we were 23.9 trillion dollars in debt, and by May 4th we were 25 trillion dollars in debt.

Fear of the coronavirus has caused nearly all of our politicians to suddenly become socialists, and we are being told that trillions more in spending may be coming. This is complete and utter lunacy, and we are leaving future generations of Americans with a mountain of debt that would absolutely crush them.

But of course our society may not even last too much longer at the rate we are going.

For years I have been loudly warning that our absurd national debt is an existential threat to Americas future, but at this point both major political parties have completely abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility.

Now our national debt is rapidly speeding toward the 26 trillion dollar mark, and the House of Representatives just passed a bill that would borrow and spend an additional 3 trillion dollars that we do not currently have

Last week, House Democrats unveiled their latest pandemic-relief package. The bill combines aid for families, a bailout for struggling cities and states, and additional funds for testing, tracing, and hospitals. The price tag is about $3 trillionand it comes just weeks after the president signed an economic-relief package worth about $2 trillion.

Since we are destroying the nation anyway, why dont we make the grand total a nice round 10 trillion dollars like the progressives at the Atlantic are suggesting?

After all, we added close to 10 trillion dollars to the national debt during the Obama years and hardly anyone seemed to mind.

Of course Trump is trying to outdo Obama.  We have already added more than 5 trillion dollars to the national debt while he has been in office, and it looks like more coronavirus relief bills could be on the way.

Yes, borrowing and spending money that we do not have gives us an economic boost in the present.

But it is also money that we are stealing from future generations, and we are systematically destroying the bright future that they were supposed to have.

Since Barack Obamas first day in the White House, we have been stealing an average of more than 100 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day.

And under Trump, that pace has actually increased.

I know that figure is difficult to believe, but run the numbers yourself and you will see that I am correct.

What we are doing to future generations is beyond criminal, and it should make every American deeply angry.

But instead, many Americans are convinced that we arent spending enough.

In fact, Mark Cuban believes that the government should be issuing $1,000 checks to each household every two weeks

The federal government has already sent a one-time check of up to $1,200 to millions of American families, but according to Mark Cuban, the stimulus is not enough to offset the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic.

The billionaire entrepreneur proposed the government issue $1,000 checks to every American household every two weeks for the next two months, with the caveat that the money must be spent within 10 days of receipt or it expires. It would cost about $500 billion, Cuban estimated.

Everybody knows that you should never go full Weimar Republic, but since we are essentially doing that already, why not make it $10,000 for every household every two weeks?

After all, $1,000 doesnt go as far as it once did.  These days, you can blow $1,000 in a single trip to the grocery store.

Of course I am being facetious.  We are literally watching our leaders destroy everything that all previous generations of Americans fought so hard to build, and it is absolutely infuriating.

At this point even the ultra-liberal Washington Post is admitting that the national debt is out of control, but of course the Post also keeps on promoting ultra-liberal spending policies.

We are like a morbidly obese guy that cant even fit in his own bathtub anymore because he is so addicted to food.  Our addiction is debt, and no matter how loud the warnings get we are just going to keep going back for more.

Ultimately, the only way that the U.S. is going to be able to service this exploding debt is to wildly devalue the currency.  This is the road that the Weimar Republic, Venezuela and so many others have gone down, and it always ends in utter disaster.

Only this time the biggest economy on the entire planet is doing it, and the currency that we are devaluing is the reserve currency of the world.

Sadly, there is no turning back now.  Both political parties are completely committed to this course, and the mainstream media is fully behind them.  In fact, CNN insists that now is not the time to cut back on the borrowing.

So when will be the time to cut back on borrowing?

If we need to add trillions to the national debt to deal with a relatively minor crisis like this coronavirus pandemic, what in the world are we going to do when really bad stuff starts happening?

Last November, I was absolutely horrified when our national debt hit the 23 trillion dollar mark.  But by the time this November rolls around, we might be at the 27 or 28 trillion dollar mark.

Unfortunately, we throw the word trillion around so much these days that most Americans dont even realize how much money a trillion dollars actually is.

If you would have been spending a million dollars every single day since Jesus was born, you still would not have spent a trillion dollars by now.

We are talking about an amount of money that is absolutely unimaginable, and we just added that much money to the national debt in less than a month.

Thanks to our free spending politicians and everyone that is supporting them, there is now no future for this country.

We are literally committing national suicide in front of the whole world, but we are so utterly consumed by our addiction that we dont even realize that we should be deeply ashamed of ourselves.",FAKE,TRUE
52,52,"A little over two weeks ago, I wrote to you about the corona virus (COVID-19) epidemic in a blog post titled, Corona Virus: What to Do. In that post, I suggested that corona virus, like most flu-like viruses, can be effectively managed with a holistic approach of eating a diet free of refined sugar, taking vitamins and mineralsparticularly vitamins A, C, and D as well as iodine, and avoiding the flu shot.
Why avoid the flu shot? The flu shot is approximately 1-2% effective in preventing the fluthat is the absolute risk difference which is much more reliable than relative risk difference. That means the flu shot fails to protect the vast majority who receive it. And, there are studies that found those who get the flu shot are MORE susceptible to similar non-flu-like viruses including, you guessed it, corona virus. Getting the flu shot and increasing ones risk to other flu- and non-flu-like illnesses was first written about 60 years ago by Thomas Francis, Jr., M.D. (1) Sixty years of an expensive, lousy medical intervention is enough; the flu vaccine should be pulled from the market.
But, I digress.
The new corona virus, COVID-19 is still spreading in China and elsewhere. As of 2.14.20, the data indicates that 1,400 have died and over 64,000 are infected. Although those numbers are grim, I would like to put them in perspective . These numbers correlate to a 2% death rate (1,400/64,000). In other words, 98% of those infected survive. Keep in mind, those are the reported numbers. I am certain there are many more infected people who are staying home convalescing on their own. Factoring those individuals in the total numbers would lower the death rate.
Any death is a tragedy, but the death rate from this new corona virus strain is not severe. I think we will see a significant amount of corona virus infection in the US but I think our death rate will be lower. We do not live in as crowded nor as polluted conditions as the Chinese do in the affected cities.
As with any viral illness, the best protective measures are to ensure the body has all the nutrients it needs to maintain a strong immune system. That means eating a clean diet free of refined sugar, maintaining optimal hydration and ensuring that you have optimal levels of vitamins and minerals.
At my office, we find great success with doing IV nutrient therapy when our patients are ill with a viral or bacterial infection. I received a note from a physician colleague of mine (a Yooper) who, at my request, gave himself a hydrogen peroxide IV and recovered from the flu in a day. Intravenous vitamin C, glutathione and ozone are other therapies that also help with viral infections.
Holistically, there are a lot of things to do for a viral infection like corona virus. Conventionally, there is little to offer. My best suggestion? Become a patient at the Center for Holistic Medicine . We have many safe and effective therapies to treat viral, bacterial, parasitic, and yeast infections. IF you dont live near my office, find a holistic practitioner near you.
My final predictions: The corona virus (COVID-19) will cause a large number of US citizens to become ill with an eventful viral illness. I think the death rate will be low. However, viruses can mutate. It is best to prepare yourself in advance by following the steps I outlined in this and my previous blog post, Corona Virus: What To Do.",FAKE,FAKE

Posted by u/asianblaazin 10 days ago Novel coronavirus: Could it be a racial bioweapon? Please listen to this before dismissing it out of hand. There is something odd about Novel coronavirus.
First, we are told that it originated in the Huahan Seafood Market, but according to a Lancet article patient zero had no connection whatsoever ( https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)... ) with the Seafood Market.
Second, this virus has some highly unusual properties that are not seen in any typical upper respiratory infection. It is unusual for a virus to be very infectious without symptoms. For example, The common cold is infectious from a few days before your symptoms appear until all of the symptoms are gone. Flu is usually most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further 3 to 7 days. That is because in order to spread from one person to another, a virus usually has to be present in large amounts in the body. This virus is insanely infectious before symptoms begin.
https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/infections/how-long-is-s...
Third, the genomic properties are highly unusual. It is an RNA virus which mutates unusually fast, making it difficult to treat as its signature changes all the time. According to Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a search of 2019-nCoV middle fragment revealed no considerable similarity with any of the previously characterized corona viruses. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises also half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cell. Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event.
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.920249v1
Notably, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors which are far more common among Asian men. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells).
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full
Fourth, the virus originated in the most central city in China at the time most likely for it to spread uncontrolled, the even of the Lunar New Year where travel is massive.
While there is no proof it is a bioweapon, the confluence of factors is highly unusual. Before this, the Chinese nation was heavily feared as a rising challenge to the established world order. Those who want to see a weaker China and reverse its economic gains have great cause to privately celebrate the emergence of coronavirus.

79,79,"There is one thing that I feel like explaining and get out of the way before I get started with this article, this is the fact that I have no background or any real medical training, beside first aid in the army and nation guard. So if you are looking for medical advice or any expert information about the current Corona outbreak, you should seek this from official sources, because this is all about my opinions and observations. How I see it from the view of an expat that loves to travel and explore the world around us, nothing more and nothing less. At the same time, I do not wish to fuel the fire any more than it already has been by the media focus on it these past few days.
With that out of the way, I have to say if you listen to the media and look at how China now are treating the outbreak you can easily get the feeling that its the end of the world or a doomsday scenario. With millions of people and entire cities put in forced quarantine, not to forget the fact that an entire industry seems to have been shut down by tens of thousands of flights has been cancelled just in and out of China alone. I want to stay positive and say that this is an overreaction, but if that's the case, it's not a bad thing. As a known Youtuber said in one of his videos this week, it's better to overreact and deal with the problem than have an underreaction and make it worse.
So when I am looking at all of this through the glasses of an expat that loves to travel and has been to China, it looks horrible and I feel like the joy of travel are under attack by this. That the end result will be that it will affect travel in the long run or at least make it more difficult to move around as freely as we do today. Because of my experience, there always comes regulations after an episode like this in an attempt to prevent the spread in future events. At the same time, I am worried about how big this thing really is, because if you look at how China is reacting, it does look like an end of days scenario and things have never in history been done or had a reaction of this magnitude.
I know that my focus on my own passion in all of this might seem a bit selfish, but at the same time, its something that is very dear to me and I would call it natural. When it comes to the outbreak itself, as I see it its important to be prepared and have a personal plan to deal with it if it comes to your parts of the wood. Things like stocking up on water, food and other things you need. Not just to prepare for this, but at the same time being prepared for other events in the future. This is something that I try my best to live by myself, to have some stock of food and such stored in case something would happen. Call me a prepper if you want, I call it common sense.
At the same time, I am sitting here in Peru with a family where both I and my son has an asthma thing going and an old mother sitting back home in Norway, so I guess it's normal to worry a bit more I guess. Not that I believe this would be a major thing but it does seem like its being treated more seriously than like SARS and similar outbreaks in the past. Again this can just be how the media are treating it, to make some money on the Coronavirus, but it doesn't hurt anyone to be prepared. That is the angle I am taking, better to overreact than underreact. That way you will have what you need in case this is the big one.
If I would be giving one advice it would be this, treat this as the big one and prepare for the worst, but at the same time, it's important not to panic based on the overflow of information that's happening at the moment. Because it's not to get around, the media will over inform you with big letters just to make a few extra clicks and some extra cents. The only thing you can is to stock up on food, water, gas and whatever medicine you might need in case it hits your part of the world. At the same time and this is important, focus on personal hygiene and always have a bottle of disinfectant close by, since this one also spreads through touch, but at the same time do not panic.
I would say that being prepared is the very best advice I can give anyone and that is important not to panic, I know its easier said than done. I would also say, do not listen to the mainstream media as its called, but if you have any questions, call your local authorities or if it's about the development of the outbreak you can check out this link ( confirmed 2019  nCOV cases globally map ) it will direct you to the American CDC official site. At the same time, I want to underline that my article is based on personal opinions, feelings and observations. Keep in mind that I am not a medical professional in any way, shape or form. Just a worried expat blogger with his own opinions and thoughts on the matter and treat me as such! ",FAKE,TRUE
80,80,"Death from the coronavirus will result in over ten years of life lost per person, according to new research from a Scottish university.
A team of researches at the University of Glasgow has taken analysis beyond the number of deaths, and looked at how it will impact humanity in the long run.
In an analysis published on Thursday, they say the number of years of life lost per person appear to be similar to diseases such as coronary heart disease.
As most people dying with Covid-19 are older with underlying chronic conditions, some have speculated that the impact of the condition may have been overstated and that the actual number of years of life lost as a result of Covid-19 are relatively low, explains Dr David McAllister, who is leading the research team.
READ MORE: Coronavirus in Scotland: Researchers explore impact of virus on body
This new analysis found that death from Covid-19 results in over ten years of life lost per person, even after taking account of the typical number and type of chronic conditions found in people dying of Covid-19.
""Among people dying of Covid-19, the number of years of life lost per person appear similar to diseases such as coronary heart disease.""
They say this information is important as it ensures governments and the public to not wrongly underestimate the effects of Covid-19 on individuals.
The study reports estimated years of life lost due to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number and type of chronic conditions.
To conduct the research, the team took information from Italy on the age at which people with Covid-19 died, and the number and type of chronic conditions they had.
Their report, published in Wellcome Open Research but not yet peer-reviewed, states: Among patients dying of COVID-19, there appears to be a considerable burden in terms of years of life lost (YLL), commensurate with diseases such as coronary heart disease or pneumonia.
READ MORE: 'Objects' better recognised historically than women in Scotland , says study
""While media coverage of the pandemic has focused heavily on COVID-19 affecting people with underlying health conditions, adjustment for number and type of long-term conditions only modestly reduces the estimated years of life lost due to COVID-19 compared to estimates based only on age and sex.
""Public health agencies and governments should report on YLL, ideally adjusting for the presence of underlying long-term conditions, to allow the public and policy-makers to better understand the burden of this disease

101,101,"The Wuhan corona virus is increasingly resembling a pandemic, say infectious disease experts worldwide The Wuhan corona virus is increasingly resembling a pandemic, say infectious disease experts worldwide
The Wuhan corona virus, which is spreading from China, is likely to become a pandemic around the world, according to many of the world's leading experts in infectious diseases.
The prospects are enormous. A pandemic  an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents  1; can have global consequences, despite the exceptional travel restrictions and quarantines that China and other countries, including the United States, are now imposing.
Scientists do not yet know how deadly the new thing is. However, the corona virus is such that there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic could do. However, there is growing consensus that the pathogen can be easily transmitted between people.
The Wuhan coronavirus spreads more like the highly transmissible influenza than the slow-moving viral cousins SARS and MERS, which scientists have discovered.
] ""It is very, very transferable and is almost certainly going to be a pandemic,"" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
""But will it be catastrophic?"" I dont know. ""
In the past three weeks, the number of cases confirmed in the laboratory has increased from around 50 in China to more than 17,000 in at least 23 countries. There were more than 360 deaths.
However, various epidemiological models estimate that the actual number of cases is 100,000 or more, and while this expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is a huge leap beyond what virologists saw in the development of SARS and MERS.
As SARS im Only 8,098 cases were confirmed after the 9th month of spread was defeated in July 2003. MERS has been in circulation since 2012, but only about 2,500 cases are known.
According to experts, the greatest uncertainty is currently how many people there are around the world, SARS killed approximately 10 percent of those who received it, and MERS now kills approximately 1 in 3.
The ""Spanish Flu"" of 191 8 only killed about 2.5 percent of its victims  but because it infected so many people and medical care was very extensive. In the meantime, 20 to 50 million people died. Pedestrians wear face masks in Bangkok. By contrast, by Amanda Mustard  2020 The New York Times
The 2009 highly communicable H1N1 swine flu pandemic killed about 285,000 people, less than seasonal flu, and had a relatively low mortality rate of an estimated 0.02 percent.
The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus was around two percent, although this will likely decrease as more tests are performed and milder cases are found.
It is ""increasingly less likely that the virus can be contained,"" said Dr. Thomas R Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who is now leading Resolve to Save Lives, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting epidemics.
Spread like flu and other organisms, but we still don't know how far, wide, or deadly it will be. ""
In the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, they talked about Armageddon in Mexico."" Fauci said. (This virus first appeared in pig breeding areas in the Mexican state of Veracruz.) ""However, it turned out to be not so serious.""
An exact estimate of the lethality of the virus is only possible when certain types of studies are available: blood tests, to determine how many people have antibodies, household studies to find out how often they infect family members, and genetic sequencing to determine if some strains are more dangerous than others.
Border closures on highly infectious pathogens never succeed completely. Experts said because all borders are somewhat permeable. However, closures and strict preventive examinations can slow the spread, which saves time for the development of drugs and vaccines.
Other important unknowns are who is at greatest risk, whether cough or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus. How quickly the virus can mutate and whether it fades in warmer weather.
The effects of a pandemic would likely be more severe in some countries than in others. While the US and other wealthy countries may be able to identify and quarantine the first airlines, countries with fragile health systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.
""This looks much more like H1N1 spread than SARS, and I'm increasingly alarmed,"" said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""Even one percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths per million people.""
Other experts were more cautious.
Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the emergency department of the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there is ""evidence that this virus can still be contained"" and that the world has to ""keep trying"".
Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus hunter at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health who advises his disease control and prevention center in China, said that while the virus is clearly transmitted through accidental contact, the laboratories always handle samples are still behind.
Over the past two years, life in China has changed radically for weeks. The streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens wear masks and wash their hands, said Lipkin. All of this may have slowed the exponential growth of the infection.
It is not clear how accurate the tests in crowded Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media reported test kit bottlenecks and processing bottlenecks that could lead to an under-count.
However, Lipkin knew of a laboratory that performed 5,000 samples a day, which could lead to false positive results that inflate the count. ""You may not be able to do quality control at this rate,"" he said.
Anecdotal reports from China and a published study from Germany indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show any symptoms. This could make border control considerably more difficult, the scientists say.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control released an epidemiological model on Friday. It is estimated that 75 percent of those infected from China entering Europe are still in the incubation period after their arrival. and therefore not recognized by the airport screening, which searches for fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
But if thermal imagers miss victims who are beyond the incubation period and actively infect others, the actual number of missing carriers can be higher than 75 percent. [19659002] Nevertheless, asymptomatic carriers are ""usually not the main drivers of epidemics,"" said Fauci. Most people fall ill with someone they know is sick  a family member, a co-worker, or a patient.
The most vulnerable target of the virus is Africa, many experts said. There, more than a million Chinese work abroad, mainly in mining, drilling or engineering projects. In addition, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus was found.
If someone on the continent has the virus now, I'm not sure if the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it. Daniel Bausch, director of scientific programs at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, is consulting with the WHO on the outbreak.
South Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose this, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked WHO for the genetic material and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but it will take some time.
At least four African countries have quarantined suspected cases, according to an article published on Friday in South China Morning Post . You have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.
Currently, the virus is unlikely to spread widely in countries with a strong, vigilant healthcare system, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
""Every doctor in the US has this attitude,"" he said. Every patient with a fever or breathing problems gets two questions. & # 39; Have you ever been to China? Did you have contact with someone who is in contact? If the answer is yes, they are immediately isolated.
Assuming that the virus spreads worldwide, tourism in and trade with countries outside of China could be affected  and the urgency to find ways to stop the virus and prevent deaths will increase. Many viruses, such as flu, measles and noroviruses, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak started in winter and the MERS transmission is also peaking, although this may be related to transmission in newborn camels.
Four mild corona viruses cause about a quarter of the nationwide colds, which also peak in winter.
But even if there is no outbreak in June, a second wave could occur in autumn, as was the case with any major flu pandemic, including those that started in 1918 and 2009.
Some drugs may be available at this time.
Several antiviral drugs are prescribed in China. A common combination is pills with lopinavir and ritonavir and infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.
In the USA, the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for HIV therapy and is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic manufacturers manufacture HIV medicines for low prices in Africa, and their products are approved by the WHO.
Another option could be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the Gilead patent is granted. The drug is not yet approved for the treatment of diseases. However, there are indications that it works against corona viruses, and Gilead has donated cans to China.
Several US companies are working on a vaccine using various combinations of own funds, taxpayers' money and foundation grants.
Although modern genetic engineering techniques have made it possible to develop vaccine candidates within a few days. According to medical ethics, these must then be carefully tested for safety and effectiveness in animals and a small number of healthy people.
This aspect of the process cannot be accelerated upwards because it can take some time for dangerous side effects to occur and because the human immune system takes time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine works.

The minister replied to a growing chorus of criticism with a number of trending hashtags on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of tweets from the public expressing concern over the situation.
The minister categorically denied that the government was prioritising tourism over public safety but also pointed to the possibility of further precautions and steps been taken as the threat is being constantly reviewed and managed.
This includes a national committee to coordinate the activities of government agencies.
If it reaches a point where public health is in danger, we will take action, the Public Health Minister insisted. Detecting infected patients is a good sign because it shows that our system is efficient. Public concern over the grim news from China
The source of the public concern is easy to understand as matters across the border in central and southern China are growing decidedly grimmer.
The key concern among western medical experts is that China is downplaying the extent of the outbreak and more worryingly, that the transmission of the virus is growing more effective with person to person transmission. Outbreak could end up worse than SARS lack of trust in Chinese authorities spooking concern
One public health expert, in recent days, has pointed out that this outbreak could more infectious that the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 but with a lower mortality rate of 3% as compared to 11% for SARS. More or less infectious than SARS, a key question
However, there is some disagreement as to whether this virus is more infectious with experts complaining that current information on the virus is based on preliminary and incomplete data. Some experts this week have suggested that this disease is more infections.
The World Health Organisation on January 23rd, however, was ambiguous suggesting that it was being contracted via person to person transmission by coughing and sneezing.
The WHO estimates the R0 (rate of infected people per carrier) for the current virus is somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5 which indicates how many people are infected by each sufferer. This would be compared to 2.0 to 4.0 for SARs which was reduced to 0.4 when strict measures were introduced to curb that virus outbreak in April 2003.
The WHO figure is based on an exploratory analysis but there is a view among some experts that this outbreak is spreading faster and is more difficult to contain. More cases being announced as serious
What is being noticed is that more and more of the new infections have been revealed to involve more serious cases of the infection.
At this stage, experts do not know whether this is because of the inconsistency of figures coming from the communist government state apparatus in China or an infection that is growing more virulent and infectious with person to person transmission.
In Thailand, as of now, there has been no case yet of person to person transmission of the virus but that is no reason to be complacent. Some international experts warn that up to 100,000 people may already be infected in China
At present, the Chinese authorities have now confirmed 2,744 infections but this is rising sharply and with over 80 deaths. However, some sources among the international scientific community now believe that there may be over 100,000 people infected. Deaths now occurring outside Hubei province
Up to Thursday, all the deaths were confined to the central Chinese province of Hubei. Of the 80 deaths confirmed by Chinese authorities to Monday, 76 were in the province Hubei which is home to the city Wuhan at the centre of the outbreak.
However, figures from Chinese authorities overnight revealed that out of 769 new cases, only half of these were in the locked-down province containing 60 million people. Face masks mandatory in some provinces and cities
This raises concern for other provinces. Chinese officials have ordered that the wearing of face mask in public be made mandatory in Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces where over 160 people million live. Thai government considering the evacuation of nationals from Hubei province and Wuhan
Meanwhile, the focus in Thailand has also switched to Thai students and spa workers stranded in Hubei province as other countries evacuate their nationals.
It is being reported that the Royal Thai Air Force has four C-130 aircraft on standby with medical teams to evacuate the Thai nationals from the ravaged area although reports from the Thai embassy in Beijing today point out that restaurants are still open in the province even though transport is restricted and inhabitants encouraged not to go out. McDonalds is closed in Hubei
McDonalds, the popular US hamburger chain, on Friday confirmed that it had suspended operations in 5 cities in Hubei province because of the current medical emergency. Chinese students told to delay return by 2 weeks
There is also concern about 7,000 Chinese students in Thai universities who have travelled home for the holidays to China. At present, they are being encouraged to delay their return for two weeks until the situation is clarified. Strengthened hygiene regimes in public places
As well as bolstering screening and reviewing the situation with a view to elevating precautionary measures, it is also being reported that Thai transport companies and public facilities such as shopping malls are being encouraged to introduce heightened hygiene regimes. Tourism Minister warns of a 50 billion loss while Health Minster points to a proportionate response

134,134,"Million fled Wuhan threatening to spread ""Corona"" in the world The British newspaper ""The Sun"", highlighted the new research conducted by the University of ""Southampton"" on the British Corona virus, warns of the possibility of spreading millions of people fleeing the Chinese city of Wuhan - the epidemic outbreak - for the virus around the world The university published a picture of the map prepared by the university, saying that the virus seems to be unstoppable and will spread all over the world, depending on technical data to predict the rapid spread of the new virus, which reached alarming results, according to the British newspaper. The research study says that before January 23, before the announcement of the quarantine on Wuhan, thousands traveled by air from the endemic region, to 382 cities outside China, warning that the majority of those cities are located in Asia, Europe, the United States, and Australia, pointing to the existence of A strong relationship between expected import risks and reported cases. The graph prepared by the university reveals how 5 million Wuhan residents - the virus' homeland - fled from scratch before the Chinese city was quarantined. The researchers cautioned that comprehensive checks should be conducted for travelers, especially in cities where cases of HIV infection were recorded, all over the world before next April, to limit the spread of the virus beyond the current range. During the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, hundreds of Chinese traveled from cities at risk to Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, and some African countries including Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria and Kenya. The study warned the world of the spread of the new virus and the need to be well prepared to contain its spread, especially as it is likely that what it described as ""international export"" of the virus will happen. ""It is definitely too late, five million are outside,"" said Chinese virologist Jin Dongyan, a researcher with the College of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Hong Kong. ""This is a big challenge, many of them may not return to Wuhan but wander around elsewhere."" The British newspaper says that this study was conducted after medical examinations of a number of citizens at the hospital ""East Sussex GP"" in Britain, after two doctors were diagnosed with Corona virus, prompting the British government to temporarily close a health center in Brighton. The British authorities announced that they are searching for all the people who met a businessman who was found infected with the Coronavirus, numbering 11 people. The authorities said, in a statement, that the 53-year-old British businessman, Steve Walsh, contracted the virus during a work visit to Singapore and transferred it to 11 other people while passing through France and Spain, on the way back to his country. According to the British newspaper, the 11 injured are currently receiving treatment, including 5 in France, 5 others in Britain, and one injured in Spain, including a nine-year-old child. The British authorities are currently searching for the rest of the people who have met a businessman who is infected with the virus, to make sure they are infected with the virus or not. The new Corona claimed to date 1113 lives in mainland China, while the number of people infected with the epidemic in the country exceeded 44 thousand, after recording about 2500 new cases of the virus during the past 24 hours, according to the National Health Committee in China.

The copy will be used by Australia's public health laboratories for what is known as a positive control, to show if a particular treatment is working, and will also be sent to experts working with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe, Druce said.
Mike Catton , deputy director of the Doherty Institute, said in a statement that having a sample of the virus would enable experts to use their arsenal of molecular technology to combat the virus.
The team believes the efforts will help with the creation of an antibody testwhich can show if a person's immune system has been activated against the virus, said Catton . According to the information currently available, the WHO believes the virus has an incubation period of between two to 10 days.
""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" he explained.
""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines. We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,"" Catton said.
The team also released a video showing the coronavirus in culture.
The team's research is among global efforts from scientists working to gain an understanding of the virus dubbed 2019- nCoV . The virus is a member of the large coronavirus family, which cause a range of conditions from the common cold to more severe infections like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ).

142,142,"The Department of Health said Tuesday that it is investigating a suspected case of 2019-novel corona virus (2019-nCov) involving a Chinese boy from Wuhan, China, who arrived into the country last week, for manifesting common symptoms of the disease.
Health Sec. Francisco Duque III with WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abetasinghe in a press conference at the DOH office in Manila on Tuesday, January 21, 2020. The DOH is investigating the case of a 5-year-old child who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China for manifesting fever, throat irritation and cough prior to entering the country. (JANSEN ROMERO / MANILA BULLETIN)
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said samples from the five-year-old child, who is now being isolated in a hospital in Cebu City, yielded negative results for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
The samples, however, tested positive for the non-specific pancoronavirus, which at present remained unidentified. The specimen, Duque said, has been sent to Victorian Infectious Diseases References Laboratory in Australia to identify the specific coronavirus strain.
The results will be out after 24 hours, the secretary said.
In simple words, the test shows that there is a coronavirus, but its not SARS and not MERS-Cov. We still do not know what it is, so we have to send it to Australia to know if it is identical to the 2019-nCoV, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said.
The child, who arrived in Cebu City last Jan. 12 with his mother to attend to documents on his education, manifested fever, throat irritation, and cough before entering the Philippines.
The patient as of today is experiencing cough but is currently stable and afebrile, Duque said.
Contact tracing was also conducted on all passengers seated four seats away from the child during their trip to Cebu. None of them showed symptoms.
Throat samples from three Chinese patients, who earlier manifested flu-like symptoms upon arriving at the Kalibo International Airport, were sent to the Research Institute Tropical Medicine (RITM) for testing. All three cases are currently well and are no longer manifesting any symptoms, Duque said.
On Dec. 31, 2019, a clustering of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was later determined to be caused by a new coronavirus strain dubbed 2019-nCov, a strain that has not been previously identified in humans. As of present, 222 cases were reported in China while four confirmed cases from Thailand, Japan, and South Korea were reported.
The health agency said Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from common cold to more serious infections such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Common signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.
While tests are being done to identify which specific virus is present in the samples from the five-year-old child, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised the public to refrain from being anxious about the disease.
We have to recognize that the testing is not widely available this time, we are working with the RITM to fill the capacity, so at this point of time dont be anxious unless you have traveled to Wuhan, WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.
The health experts said that while there are still a lot of things we dont know about the virus, the public is urged to practice proper hygiene and proper cough etiquette all the time.

We would like to appeal to the Government of the Republic of Zambia and the general populous to take keen interest in the outbreak of the mysterious and deadly new corona-virus in the Chinese City of Wuhan fast spreading to other cities like Beijing, UPND Spokesman Charles Kakoma has said.
With the United States of America (USA) screening for the Wuhan virus outbreak at 3 major airports, we urge the Zambian government to urgently look into this matter and commence screening points across all our major or high risk borders,Mr Kakoma said.
We are of the view that seeking quick remedial interventions by the Ministry of Health in collaborations with the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) would help prevent the new corona-virus from being transmitted by those travelling from Wuhan City to Zambia.
Mr Kakoma said the UPND believes that Government should take keen interest in this important issue as failure to do so would result in loss of lives in Zambia as the Wuhan virus is very deadly.
And owing to the rapidity at which the disease is said to be spreading, we believe that it would be prudent for the Government to engage major stakeholders and look into this matter and furnish our people with the symptoms of the deadly new corona virus and the possible primary prevention steps.
Further, we wish to appeal to the Zambian Embassy in China to furnish the Zambian people both in that country and here on whether there are any modalities that have been put in place to ensure that Chinese nationals intending to travel to Zambia or Zambians traveling back home are thoroughly screened to ensure that the disease is contained, he said.

He pointed out that the Minister is following up the preventive measures taken in accordance with WHO guidelines. Mogahed added that the Minister met with medical teams, and reviewed with them the preventive measures within the medical insurance plan developed by the Ministry to address the emerging coronavirus and prevent its entry into the country. Discussions included procedures necessary in the case of suspicion or infection, and how to deal with infected persons when symptoms appeared. Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less-severe disease, such as the common cold, and others causing more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not. Symptoms of the virus include fever and cough, and some people should have difficulty breathing. The symptoms appear to set in between two days and two weeks after a person has been exposed to the virus.",TRUE,TRUE

164,164,"Bureau of Quarantine, local health units are on top of coronavirus situation: DOH-7 assures By: Rosalie Abatayo January 21,2020 - 08:06 PM
CEBU CITY , Philippines  The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) assured the public that the local health units and the Bureau of Quarantine are on top of the situation amid their confirmation that a Chinese boy is under investigation for testing positive for a non-specific strain of pan-coronavirus.
DOH-7 Director Dr. Jaime Bernadas said the BOQ and the health units in towns and cities, as well as hospitals, are fully aware of the protocols that they have to observe when facing the coronavirus threat.
Bernadas added that their protocol on the coronavirus is not new among health workers considering the previous history of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (Mers- Cov), both caused by different strains of the corona virus.
Bernadas said the 5-year-old Chinese boy, whom Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed to have tested positive for an unidentified strain of the virus, is currently under isolation.
Based on the boys travel documents, Bernadas said the boy and his mother are originally from Wuhan City in China, the same place where the novel coronavirus strain was first reported.
The coronavirus from Wuhan City, dubbed as coronavirus 2019, has reportedly cost four fatalities to date.
The health official said the childs condition has already improved and has already become asymptomatic since he was admitted on the morning of January 12. However, the child and his mother remains in isolation in a medical facility in Cebu City pending the release of the confirmatory test from Australia.
Bernadas said all they have determined from the first test of the RITM is that the coronavirus that the child got was different from that of Sars and Mers-Cov.
While the samples have already been sent out to Australia over the weekend, Bernadas said that they are expecting the results to be out within 24 to 48 hours from today, January 21.
Bernadas added that they are now tracing all people that had contact with the boy and his mother upon arriving in Cebu, including those that were with them in their flight heading to Cebu.",TRUE,TRUE

Beware of Myths It is safe to receive a letter or a package from China. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new virus. Coronaviruses do not survive for a long period on objects like letters or packages. There is no evidence that animals/pets such as dogs or cats can get infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always in your best interests to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various bacteria that can pass from pets to humans. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, provide no protection against the new coronavirus. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline protects people from infection with the new coronavirus. Limited evidence suggests that regularly rinsing nose with saline can hasten recovery from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. There is no evidence that using mouthwash protects you from infection with the new coronavirus. Some brands of mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not protect you from the new coronavirus infection. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. Certain chemical disinfectants can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform. However, they have little to no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It is dangerous to put these chemicals on the skin. People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) have increased odds of becoming severely ill with the virus. People of all ages are advised to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene. Antibiotics do not work against viruses. The new coronavirus is a virus. Hence, antibiotics should not be used prevent or treat 2019-nCoV. Patients hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV may receive antibiotics as bacterial co-infection is possible. There is no specific medicine yet recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. Those infected with the virus must be given appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are being investigated, and will be tested through clinical trials.
Continue asking patients with suspected flu or diarrhea if they, or someone they have been in contact with, recently returned from coronavirus-affected area.
Coronavirus is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (It is mandatory to report to WHO human and animal cases) as person-to-person transmission in UK, USA, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam and two deaths, one in the Philippines on Feb 2 (44 M) and 2nd in Hong Kong (39 M), outside of mainland China, have been confirmed.
The virus behaves like SARS with 2 % case fatality (15% of admitted cases), time to death 14 days, 3-4 reproductive number R0, has its origin from bats, spreads through large droplets and predominantly from people having lower respiratory infections, and hence universal droplet precautions are the answer.
Status
The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan, China, has now spread to 28 countries and territories worldwide, with 24552 confirmed cases and 492 deaths (median age 45, range 2-74, predominantly males , deaths more in comorbid cases, just like SARS, it mostly does not affect children 15 years of age or less). There were 64 new deaths on 3rd Feb. It is anticipated that one lac people are already infected.
Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Finland, Sweden and Spain.
Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China.
Its not new
Every decade a zoonotic coronavirus seems to cross species and infect human populations. This decade has seen a virus, the 2019-nCoV, first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market in mid-December 2019.
CORONA: Crown or Coronary artery
The virus belongs to the corona virus family and has an RNA core. The term corona stands for crown or the halo around the sun. The arteries that supply oxygen to the heart are also called coronary arteries, as the heart is considered the crown. When seen under an electron microscope, the virus appears round in shape with spikes poking out from its periphery.
The three deadly human respiratory coronaviruses so far - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) 2019-nCoV: The virus is 75-80% identical to the SARS-CoV
The virus
2019-nCoV is quite different from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. According to the structural analysis, 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. This single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome ranges from 26 to 32 kilobases in length.
The case fatality is lower than SARS, MERS and EBOLA
2019-nCoV mortality rate is 2% (earlier thought to be 3%) compared to 34% for MERS, 10% for SARS (out of 5327 cases), 50% for Ebola, 30-40% for small pox, 10-15% for measles (developing countries), 2-5% in children and 15-30% in adults for polio, 5-10% for diphtheria, 4% in infants < 1yr, 1% in children < 4 years for whooping cough AND < 0.1-4 % for swine flu.
If Hubei province, where the epicenter of 2019-nCoV, Wuhan, is situated, is removed from the calculation, the national (China) mortality rate comes down to 0.3%. Within the Hubei province, the mortality rate is about 1% if the city of Wuhan is excluded (where it is 5.5%).
The case fatality rate with seasonal flu is <0.01% (1 death per 10,000 cases)
Role of CMAAO and other Medical Associations
It is mandatory for all countries to be prepared for containment measures. This includes active surveillance measures, early detection, isolation and case management, tracking contacts and preventing the spread of the virus. It is important to share full data with WHO. It is a legal requirement that all countries share information with WHO under the IHR.
If 2019-nCoV is detected in an animal (information about the species, tests, and epidemiological data), it must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.
All countries should emphasize on reducing human infection, and preventing secondary transmission and international spread.
Three is no travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. All countries are required to inform WHO about any travel measures taken. Countries are cautioned against actions promoting stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.
Its Zoonotic but it is unlikely to spread through seafood in India
This new coronavirus is closely related to several bat coronaviruses. Bats seem to be the likely primary reservoir for the virus. While SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets, MERS-CoV transmitted from camels. The ancestral hosts were probably bats; however.
The virus has been traced to snakes in China, so, it is unlikely to spread in India through sea food. Snakes often hunt for bats. According to reports, snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, thus raising the likelihood that the 2019-nCoV might have moved from the host species, i.e., bats, to snakes and then to humans. It is still not understood as to how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts.
It is more infectious to humans
This new virus seems to grow better in primary human airway epithelial cells as compared to standard tissue-culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV will likely behave more like the SARS-CoV.
Human to Human infection
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV affect the intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than the upper airway cells. Transmission thus occurs primarily from patients with recognized illness and not from patients with mild, nonspecific signs. However NEJM has reported a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired outside of Asia wherein transmission seems to have taken place during the incubation period in the index patient.
2019-nCoV seems to employ the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]). T ransmission is expected to occur only after signs of lower respiratory tract disease develop.
The principal cause for breathlessness is the fact that this virus does not attack the throat alone. It attacks the lungs as well. Patients so far have not presented with a sore throat, because the 2019-nCoV attacks the intraepithelial cells of lung tissue.
A report of a small cluster of five cases indicated transmission from asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period; all patients in this cluster had mild illness. Another person got infected while using gown, but the eyes were not covered.
Its predominantly a large droplet infection
Transmission of 2019-nCoV probably occurs through large droplets and contact and less frequently by aerosols and fomites,. In lab, we need minimum BSL-3 (or BSL-4) facilities to prevent transmission.
The incubation period
Up to 2 weeks, according to WHO, with mean being 5.5 days.
Symptoms
According to a report published in the Lancet , one-third of the patients landed up in the intensive care unit; and around 15% of these succumbed to the infection. Almost all presented with fever, more than two-thirds had cough and nearly 50% had weakness or muscle ache. More than 50% had shortness of breath.
2019-nCoV presents with low white cell count and reduction in lymphocyte count, and raised liver transaminase levels.

Drugs
No proven antiviral treatment exists yet for the coronavirus. A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir exhibited some promise in patients with SARS, but this was only in the lab and not in humans. A randomized study is underway in Saudi Arabia in patients with MERS; a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and recombinant interferon beta-1b versus placebo; the results are still awaited.
Scientists in Australia have reportedly developed a lab-grown version of coronavirus. The breakthrough would help researchers globally in their efforts to develop a vaccine and detection tests.
Chloroquine, which has potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV, has been shown to have similar activity against HCoV-229E in cultured cells and against HCoV-OC43 both in cultured cells and in a mouse model. However, studies of efficacy in humans are lacking.
Thai doctors have used oseltamivir along with lopinavir and ritonavir, both HIV drugs. An experimental drug from Gilead Sciences Inc., called remdesevir, has shown encouraging results.
PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles are known to reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The World Health Organization has included PVP-I in the list of essential medicines. It exhibits a high potency for virucidal activity against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the MERS and SARS coronaviruses.
Universal droplets precautions the answer Quarantining for two weeks Timely diagnosis Strict adherence to universal precautions Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses!
Travel Requires contact of ten minutes within a distance of six feet The virus can remain alive on any surface for 3-12 hours Chose a window seat and remain there to lower your chances of encountering an infectious disease.
Contagiousness: The reproduction number, referred to as R0 or r naught is the number of additional people that an infected person can infect.
A recent study has shown Ro as high as 4.08. This exceeds WHOs estimate of 1.4-2.5 made on January 23, and also exceeds recent estimates of 3.6 -4.0 and 2.24  3.58. Preliminary studies had estimated Ro as 1.5-3.5. Going by this value, on average every case of the Novel Coronavirus would give rise to 3 to 4 new cases. An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear. The Ro for common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0.

Comparisons Every year, an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die across the globe due to complications from seasonal influenza (flu) viruses. This figure corresponds to 795 to 1,781 deaths in a day owing to seasonal flu. SARS (Nov 2002  Jul 2003) was a coronavirus with its origin in Beijing, China. It spread to 29 countries, and infected 8,096 people with 774 deaths (fatality rate of 9.6%). SARS infected 5,237 people in mainland China. Going by this figure, Wuhan Coronavirus surpassed SARS on January 29, 2020, when Chinese officials confirmed 5,974 cases of 2019-nCoV. On January 30, 2020 the novel coronavirus cases surpassed even the 8,096 cases worldwide representing the final SARS count in 2003. MERS (2012) led to the death of 858 people out of the 2,494 infected cases (fatality rate of 34.4%).

Further, the patients vitals, including blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen, and temperature all registered normal. The patient does not, therefore, meet the case definition for novel Coronavirus, the statement said.
However, the ministry said that as a precaution, the patient has been put in isolation and will remain in isolation until the symptoms abate.
The development has caused levels of concern in St Mary, sources from the parish told Loop News
The ministry is also reporting that 19 Chinese tourists who attempted to enter the island on Friday were denied entry.
It said the 19 visitors landed at the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston but were refused landing privileges, in accordance with the travel ban now in place for Jamaica.
Quarantine protocols were applied as per the Quarantine Act and the travellers left the island at approximately 10:50 am today Saturday, the statement explained.
It added further that travellers arriving on the island from China on Saturday are currently being processed, as Jamaica maintains its vigilance to protect the local population.
In terms of the patient now in isolation at the Annotto Bay Hospital, this marks the second time in four days that the Ministry has moved to calm fears about a possible case of the feared, fast-moving coronavirus on the island.
The health ministry on Tuesday called an emergency press conference after rumours swirled that a patient at the University Hospital of the West Indies, who had recently returned to the island, had contracted the virus.
Both the Minister of Health and Wellness, Dr Christopher Tufton, and the medical staff at the UHWI were quick to shut down the rumour, indicating that the patient was not presenting with symptoms of the coronavirus.
So far the virus has killed at least 259 people in China and infected an estimated 12,000. It has spread to more than 20 countries.

At the same time, the most affected Wuhan has been completely sealed. There is an atmosphere of fear among people about this virus. Every small update related to this virus can make you aware. Images Source : thesun.co.uk
Lets know where these dangerous viruses came from and what are the symptoms and prevention? Also how did it get its name. Where did this virus come from?
Several types of research have been reported so far regarding this virus. According to CNN, a doctor associated with an NGO working on environment and health has said that if you look closely at the genetic sequence of the corona virus, it looks close to the bats. A study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that according to the data found so far, the corona virus has been seen in bats before.
Chinese scientists had warned about the epidemic outbreak a year ago, and research is going on continuously in China about the diseases caused by bats. Even Chinese scientists had warned a year ago that the corona virus could spread through bats in China. The special thing is that this warning was also issued by the scientists of Wuhan. How the name Corona got :
When the Sun feels eclipse, that is, during the eclipse, when the Earth completely covers the Sun, then the sun stops appearing in the form of a sphere, but its rays show the light spreading everywhere, which is rapidly changing the universe. Looks extinct in It can also be understood in such a way that it becomes a structure similar to a sunflower flower. Which is black from the middle and soft rays of light are spreading around its circle, like the petals of sunflower. This light of the sun spreading around the shadow of the earth is called corona. For this reason, the virus was named Corona because it has a similar shape to that of Corona. Actually, the virus is round and has stained branches of proteins like the corona of the earth on its surface. Which feels spread in every direction. How to protect yourself from coronavirus
The most important thing is that if you consume sea food, then it should be avoided immediately, because the main source for the emission of corona virus is still being attributed to sea food. Since no vaccine has yet been developed to prevent coronavirus, caution is the best way to prevent it.
WHOs standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses are as follows, which include hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices: Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue  throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.",TRUE,FAKE

174,174,"Scientists released a series of over 34,000 letters that translated to the 2019-nCovs molecular blueprint after the respiratory illness emerged in China. Now, researchers from around the globe immediately took hold of the letters to develop a vaccine that will control the rampant spread of the pathogen.
Now that the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency with 7,700 confirmed cases of the infection in more than a dozen countries, scientists are racing against the clock to crack the code.
Experts are hoping to create a vaccine that will be greenlighted for clinical trials in just months. This is an ambitious target for a tedious process that can take up to a decade to complete in some cases.
University of Washingtons virologist Alex Greninger spoke about the matter to The Guardian.Basically, weve gotten a lot better at doing this, he said.
He continued: The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) already had a diagnostic test ready by the time the first patient that they tested came in. Thats amazing, and its really thanks to the sharing of that initial genome.
A recent breakthrough is expected to further speed up the process of producing the vaccine. At Melbourne, Australias Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, scientists were able to create a lab-grown version of the 2019-nCov.

With the death toll increasing rapidly in the past two weeks, Ferrer said the numbers ""are a stark reminder for all of us of the importance of slowing the spread of COVID-19,"" and the need to maintain physical-distancing and other health orders -- despite the relaxing of such rules in some jurisdictions and calls from some groups for California to follow suit.

Those institutions have accounted for a total of 3,343 cases, and 310 deaths, representing 39% of all coronavirus fatalities in the county. The vast majority of those deaths were residents of skilled nursing facilities, where testing is being ramped up this week to include all residents and staff regardless of whether they are showing any symptoms.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Wednesday night that testing will now be offered to all front-line workers -- such as health care workers, grocery and pharmacy workers, firefighters and police officers -- regardless of whether they were symptomatic. The 30-plus testing sites across the county had previously been restricted to people who were showing some type of symptoms.
Ferrer said more than 98,000 people have been tested to date across the county, with about 14% of them testing positive. She again encouraged people to get tested if they are showing symptoms, even if they might be afraid of learning the results.
""I know many people are scared of getting their results,"" she said. ""They're worried that they won't be able to manage if they're found to be positive and need to isolate. But the county family is here to help you."" ",FAKE,FAKE

183,183," Even though I wish to believe that I had something to do with this beautiful story, because my introduction of the specialist niche carmaker Xavier de le Chapelle to an Indian business group that had plans to make a sports car in India, was the genesis of this story, it is perhaps just a fond wish. De la Chapelles project died when the main Indian investor died, but Xaviers many visits to India might have had some influence in convincing his son, Cdric de la Chapelle, a guitarist from the Lyon scene, to retrace his fathers innumerable visits to India. At the same time, there is no denying that it is very much possible that Cdric would have got to India, even without the De La Chapelle sports car project history. Either way, it came to pass that Cdric and Marion, his fiance then and his wife now, whilst looking for a place to stay at Calangute, in Goa, bumped into Joseph Manuel Da Rocha, a frail 64-years-old man, who made ends meet by brokering hotel rooms to tourists. Amused and charmed by this unassuming old man, Cdric and Marion caught up with Da Rocha again, and with one beer leading to another, music and songs followed. Captivated by the old mans voice, Cdric recorded him singing a cappella. When I got back to France, reminisces Cdric, I talked to several musician friends about the idea, and little by little, we formed this group, which we decided to call Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident. Cdric de la Chapelle is, incidentally, a redhead. It was only in 2009 that we were able to bring Joe to France for our first concert at the Trans Musicales in Rennes, says Cdric, as it took us a while before we could get his paperwork sorted out in India. He used to have a passport, but that had expired in 2000. So, a new passport had to be generated, and it was the monsoons in Goa and that took some three or four months. Born on 22 March 1943, in Mumbai, Joseph Manuel Da Rocha lived the life of a waster, a wandering poet, living on the margins of society, smoking, drinking and doing drugs. Thus, when Cdric met Slow Joe, he had quite a history of drug and alcohol addiction, but had somewhat straightened out his life, working as a guide in Goa. More importantly, he had an innate musical talent and a rare crooners voice, one, which bewitched Cdric as soon as he heard the old man sing. Thus, that chance encounter on the beaches of Goa changed the lives of these two men, and marked the start of an amazing adventure. Cdric and his original band matesLucas Spirli on keyboards, Alexis Morel-Journel on bass, and Josselin Varengo on drumshelped Slow Joe build up a repertoire of new songs and formed a group around him, which was The Ginger Accident. With their very successful first concert at the 2009 edition of the Trans Musicales in Rennes, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident hit the headlines in France. In no time, they were the darling of the media, as concert spectators as well as critics took to the music and the story of this cute, but frail, old man, with that deep, gravelly voice, booming over a mix of slow rock, spiced with blues and jazz riffs. In 2011, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident released their first album Sunny Side Up , and the success of the album was reflected by a sell-out tour of France, followed by a European tour across Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. In December 2011, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident came 'home' to India, for a tour of the country, performing in Mumbai, Delhi, Goa, Bangalore, Jaipur, Kolkata, Pondicherry, Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Organised by the Alliance Franaise, the band did not get the coverage they deserved. In 2014, when Slow Joe was 71, a second album, Lost for Love , was released to even greater critical acclaim, with a newer rendering of Slow Joes song Cover me Over, a track from his first album, but this time, sung in duet with the Franco-Israeli star, Yael Naim. By early 2016, Slow Joe & The Ginger Accident had performed at over 250 concerts. In May 2016, when Slow Joe was just 73 years old, he had a fatal heart attack. This was when a third album was nearing completion. Titled Let Me Be Gone, the album was released posthumously, in February 2017, and has since risen to the top of the French charts. With Slow Joes passing, the band too has disbanded, out of sadness and respect for the memory of that lovable old Indian. There have been several eulogies in the French press and talks of a film on this sweet story have been doing the rounds. That would be the best tribute to Slow Joe, acknowledges Cdric, as he concentrates on other projects, in the meantime. ( Author of several automotive books, founder editor of many leading auto mags, Gautam Sen has also consulted with most of the Indian auto majors. He has also worked with several leading car designers such as Grard Godfroy, Tom Tjaarda and Marcello Gandini, among others.

196,196,"NEW YORK (PRWEB)April 23, 2020 A team of researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in collaboration with GenScript, is developing a synthetic antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This antibody is intended to block the virus from entering human lung cells, and would be another potential treatment option for COVID-19.
The efforts are being led by Mone Zaidi, MD, PhD, MACP, Director of the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Professor of Medicine (Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Tony Yuen, PhD, Associate Director for Research for the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have many protein ""spikes"" protruding from their outer surface. A specific region of the ""spike"" called the S1 protein binds to a molecule called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2, which is found on the surface of many human cells, including those in the lungs. This is the entry point by which the virus infects a person.
In hopes of developing a treatment that could block the viral entry into cells, Dr. Zaidi and his team, including Sakshi Gera, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are creating an antibody targeted to a peptide sequence of the S1 spike protein that should interfere with, and thereby block, the virus and prevent its initial attachment and entry into human cells.
The artificial blocking antibody then could be given to people with COVID-19 to stop the virus from infecting additional cells, much as doctors are already doing with natural antibodies harvested from people who have survived COVID-19, in what is known as convalescent plasma therapy.
""Given that convalescent plasma is showing promise and potential in treating this novel virus, the same strategy should be adopted for treatment in sick patients by creating a targeted antibody, which we hope will have the ability to disengage and block COVID-19 from entering our cells. Having experience with antibody development, my lab has embarked on this task together with the generous support of GenScript,"" said Dr. Zaidi.
The first step, now underway, is to create a custom version of the S1 spike's peptide sequence, which will be used to generate the antibody. Once the peptide sequence is available, Dr. Zaidi's team will collaborate with GenScript to generate a human antibody which will be tested for efficacy in human cells in culture and animal models. Dr. Zaidi and his team hope to then collaborate with Mount Sinai's Department of Microbiology for further antibody testing. ""It's hard to project how long it will take to have something we can test in patients, but my aim is to have a targeted antibody for first human trials within the next 12 months if all goes as planned, but it could be earlier,"" said Dr. Zaidi.
""GenScript's collaboration with Dr. Zaidi's lab to co-develop a COVID-19 antibody program signifies GenScript's ongoing commitment to work with scientific communities to annihilate and prevent COVID-19 beyond its business model. We expect that GenScript's antibody discovery and development expertise, especially in the field of COVID-19, will fuel Mount Sinai's first-rate research and development capabilities to bring this important medication to patients,"" said Kenneth Lee, Head of US Commercial Division at GenScript ProBio.

The virus has generated global alarm due to its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The recently identified strain nevertheless has lots of unknowns surrounding it, like how harmful it really is and how easily it spreads between individuals.

Doctors at a hospital in California say they have recorded more deaths from suicide than coronavirus, with a years worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a 4 week period.

Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus, reports ABC 7.

Dr. Mike deBoisblanc, the head of trauma at the hospital, said that hed never seen suicide at this rate and that the numbers were unprecedented. He now says its time to fully end the lockdown.

I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering, said Dr. deBoisblanc.

A veteran nurse who has been at the hospital for 33 years also sounded the alarm bell.

Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing
Quote: Back at the beginning of 2019, I predicted that there would be a link between 5G and a fake virus, hey presto! The area that is the epicentre of the so called virus is the same area that has reportedly been the province that 5G was rolled out with base stations.
Then we have the company Huawei offering to help combat the so called virus with their 5G base stations. I hope people wake up to this fraud that is being played out with Agenda 20/30 in mind, this is no joke.
I documented a company called InOvio about eight years ago.
This same company have just been given 9 million dollars to come up with a vaccine for corona virus. They claim they were able to do so in two hours!
The fact that they can claim to have a vaccine for a non existent virus in two hours proves that it is all fake.
INOVIO
The pioneer of DNA vaccinations is a man called Dr Weiner. This is the same man involved in the Zika vaccine.
In 2000 Dr Kim and Dr Weiner began a company called InOvio, they first had a company called VGX.
Dr Joseph Kim, teamed up with his university lecturer called Professor Weiner, who is the leading DNA technology inventor, created a few companies one was called Inovio, in which the Professor was the chairman.
The DNA technology was first used on pigs, to make pigs breed at a younger age
.Dr Kim was funded by Merck for his education, he produced something called PCV2 which is Porcine Circovirus, they were working on a veterinary drug that would help pigs escape a wasting disease.
So this was evaluated by the Dept of Homeland Security and Plum Island animal research, this DNA plasma for pigs had approval in 2005, in 2009, the swine flu vaccines were filing for a patent.
In 2009 Dr Kims company was filing with FDA to start trials on humans for the swine flu.
Dr Kim has many Merck Insiders on his board.
They created PCV1 and 2, which is Pig DNA.
Later on PVC1 and PCV2 were discovered in vaccines such as Gardasil, Rotatec and Rotarix.
A couple of years after they were given the patent for this pig DNA vaccine using PCV2 that same ingredient was found to be in Mercks Rotarix vaccine for diarrhoea and GSK vaccine Rotateq for diarrhoea.
Now how does pig virus magically turn up in a vaccine for diarrhoea?It doesnt! It gets put there. And what is unbelievable is that even though both vaccines were suspended and it transpired that all the vaccines for 2 years had been contaminated , the FDA suspended them for a few months then let them carry on.(The Information about the two drugs being suspended was found on the Medworm website and the article was written by Dr Kim).
Reports are now claiming that the coronavirus is linked to seafood after many people were reported to have contracted coronavirus from a seafood, 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
It has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.
Prof Weiner is not only the worlds DNA technology expert but he is also a special employee and adviser to the FDA.
He has perfected a new method of giving these DNA vaccines via Electroporation which is a electro magnetic pulse that opens up the cells, injects foreign DNA and then it closes.
The system has been stated by Molecular Biologists to be unsafe as it could lead to death or cancer.
They stated that only human antibody in genes is safe.
This is the same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the corona virus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology!
So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged.
They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.",FAKE,TRUE

239,239,"Overview: Calm like a bomb No new bad news on coronavirus sees mild rebound in risk markets GBP hit on UK decision to allow Huawei into parts of UK 5G network US consumer confidence still riding high AU Q4 CPI this morning
Since those APAC centres that were open yesterday went home, there has been news of more travel bans into and out of China (from the Hong Kong and UK governments to name two) but no new statistics on the official state of play with regards to coronavirus related fatalities and infection numbers. These stood at 107 deaths and around 4,500 confirmed cases. Unfortunately, the statistics are being reported as of the end of the prior day (i.e. the ones quoted here are from Monday). So we can expect updated numbers this morning and which run the risk of undoing some of the overnight moves, which include a decent bounce back in US equities, by 1.2% for the S&P 500 and 1.5% for the NASDAQ (the latter ahead of Apples results due straight after the 8:00 AEDT market close).
US Treasury yields are back higher (10s by 4bps to 1.65%) while in currencies the DXY dollar index is 0.1% higher but primarily because Sterling took a hit on news that the UK government is to permit Huawei into parts of the UK 5G network build out, news that is seen to complicate forthcoming negotiations vis--vis a US-UK post-Brexit Free Trade Agreement. Oil prices are a little firmer, which has helped NOK and CAD recoup a little of their recent loses, but gold and industrial metals are all down, which has kept the AUD on the back foot (down another 0.13% to 0.6752 and an o/n low of 0.6737). NZD is also lower and indeed underperforming AUD but for no obvious reason.
Weve had some mixed US data overnight in the form of Durable Goods Orders, Consumer Confidence (Conference Board vintage) and The Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index. Durable goods orders was all over the place thanks to a jump in defence aircraft orders but predictable slump in Boeing orders (the former holding up the headline reading relative to expectations, so 2.4% against 0.3% consensus). The key core number is therefore orders excluding defence and aircraft, which fell by 0.1% against 0.3% expected and 0.1% previously. The trend here is mildly negative, but not worryingly so.
In contrast the US consumer still looks to be in rude health, Consumer Confidence up to 131.6 from 128.0. Still off its July 2019 local highs but a second successive monthly rise and in line with the recent improvement in the University of Michigan survey. A rampant US stock market (until the last week that is) and ongoing 100k+ monthly employment gains are more than enough to justify the recent strengthening in sentiment.
The Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index jumped to 20 in January from -5 in December and which together with other regional surveys released to date offers some hope for a recovery in the manufacturing ISM next week (after a fairly flat Markit reading last Friday)
Yesterdays NAB Business Survey , which showed conditions down 1 point to 3 and confidence down 2 points to -2, related to December so will have not have picked up the full effect on business confidence and conditions from the bushfires that were at their most severe in early January. The January survey is in less than two weeks (Feb 11) so should be more revealing. The message from yesterdays survey was that business activity stabilised in Q4 but at below average levels, with forward looking indicators (forward orders, capacity utilisation, capex) still weak. Coming up in Australia
Q4 CPI is due at 11:30 ET. NAB forecasts headline at 0.7% q/q, 1.8% y/y (consensus 0.6%/1.7%) and Trimmed Mean (core) at 0.4%, 1.6% y/y (in line with consensus). We revised up our forecast for headline CPI following a stronger than expected NZ CPI (0.5%) and where the tradeables component is correlated with the Australian CPI and which was a bit stronger than expected. This also suggests some upside risk to our Trimmed Mean inflation forecast. Any upward impact on headline inflation from food prices related to supply destruction and transport bottlenecks is more likely a Q1 2020 than Q4 2019 story. Internationally
The main event (at 6:00am Thursday ET) is the FOMCs first interest rate decision of the year and subsequent press conference from Fed chair Powell. This looks like being one of the least market sensitive meeting outcomes of recent times, with no change in rates universally expected given the Feds likely assessment that has been no material change to their economic outlook  a stated precondition for changing rates  and no new economic forecast or dot plot.

The World Health Organization (WHO) released on Tuesday some facts about the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (nCoV ARD).
In a Facebook post, the special agency of the United Nations concerning international public health clarified some questions regarding the deadly respiratory virus.
 Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating nCoV ARD?
No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria, WHO said, noting that nCoV is a virus, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV ARD, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible, it added.
 Are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat nCoV ARD?
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat nCoV ARD, WHO said. It clarified that those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat the symptoms. Those with severe illness should be given optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials, it said.
 Does nCoV ARD affect older people, or are younger people are also susceptible?
People of all ages can be infected by the nCoV ARD, WHO said. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advised the public to protect themselves by observing good hand and respiratory hygiene.
 Can pets at home spread the nCoV ARD?
At present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the nCoV ARD, WHO said. They advised pet owners to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This will protect pet owners against various common bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.
According to the Department of Health, the first confirmed case of nCoV ARD in the Philippines is a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China.
WHO on Friday (PH time) declared the outbreak a global emergency, as cases have spread to at least 18 countries. The disease has claimed 213 lives as of this writing.",TRUE,FAKE

Some of the key factors propelling the market growth are rising investment by the governments in developed countries and technological advancements. However, less penetration in developing and underdeveloped countries is the restraining factor for the growth of the market.
By product, vaccines segment is segregated into anthrax, antibiotics, botulism, E-Bola, eye shield, immunization vaccine, nuclear/radiation, smallpox, and zika. Anthrax segment is expected to grow at the significant market share during the forecast period owing to the increased investment on production and stockpiling of anthrax vaccine by government agencies such as the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Department of Defense among others.
On the basis of geography, North America is anticipated to hold considerable market share during the forecast period due to increase spending by the governments across the globe to develop and store sufficient vaccines against anthrax and U.S government implementing the number of initiatives that assist them in reinforcing security against biological threats.

However, fast the Corona virus is spreading, the impact is spreading faster and wider. Fear, especially combined with government travel bans, is a powerful deterrent to tourism.
The Chinese authorities issued a ban on sales of all outbound travel packages on 24 January 2020 encouraging travel organizers to urge their clients to boycott travel. A total ban on group travel was instigated as of 27 January 2020.
The Golden week surrounding the Chinese New Year is an important time for business during a low-season period.
We estimate that about 7% of all annual outbound tourism from China takes place during the Chinese New Year was due to leave China before the travel ban took place on the 27th of January; but the evolving situation led to approximately 60% of the groups being cancelled. So, with caution, it is possible that two-thirds of the visitors expected to arrive in Europe over this period have not done so, said Tom Jenkins.
These are last minute cancellations  some within twenty-four hours  releasing space when there is little alternative demand added Jenkins.
We also need to stress that Europe  and the UK will continue to be viewed as part of Europe by long haul markets  remains virtually free of Corona virus. It needs to be free of the even more contagious and damaging threat of fear, he concluded.

264,264,"Origin plans to increase production from 100,000 per week to over a million per week by May EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- In response to the pressing need for more COVID-19 testing, Stratasys, Inc. and Origin have signed an agreement in which Stratasys will market and promote Origin 3D-printed nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs to healthcare providers and other testing centers in the U.S.
This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200423005604/en/
As widely reported, widespread testing of millions of people is currently hampered by a shortage of testing supplies. Each Origin One 3D printer has the ability to produce batches of 1,500 Origin NP O1 Swabs at a time, multiple times daily. Origin is moving towards a streamlined process allowing the production of approximately 190,000 per day, or 1.3 million per week.
Stratasys will leverage its position as a leading provider of 3D printing solutions to the healthcare industry to market Origin NP O1 Swabs. Stratasys has already been actively serving healthcare systems across the country during the pandemic by leading a coalition that has been providing 3D-printed face shields to nearly 100 front-line organizations.

""We've been impressed by the speed with which Stratasys has been able to provide thousands of shields to healthcare systems across the country and believe they are the right partner for helping get millions of swabs where they are most needed.""
Origin swabs were tested in a clinical trial with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an academic medical center affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Origin reports that results show Origin swabs performed the highest with regard to concordance to control swabs compared to two other 3D printed swabs. In addition, in subjective feedback, Origin swabs were preferred over the other 3D printed swabs.
Each Origin NP O1 Swab is autoclavable and individually packaged. More information is available at www.stratasys.com/covid-19 , along with other information about how Stratasys is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

267,267,"Hospitals and clinics in the US are moving to tentatively resume elective surgeries and other procedures that were postponed in response to COVID-19. David Hoyt, executive director of the American College of Surgeons, who is calling for a slow ramp-up in procedures, with close monitoring of community infection rates, remarked that ""testing [for the virus] would be ideal, if it was available and consistently accurate,"" but he said ""we would not recommend anyone would start [resuming elective procedures] like flipping a switch on.""
In response to the pandemic, some US states have either advised or forced hospitals to postpone various procedures, such as joint replacements and routine colonoscopies, among others not considered urgent, in a bid to prevent infection and conserve space and equipment for a potential surge of patients with COVID-19. The US government recently suggested that elective procedures could go ahead in locations where infection rates are declining, and when hospitals have adequate capacity and testing for high-risk workers. Several states, including California, Texas, New York and Ohio, are now working with healthcare providers to resume elective procedures.
A number of medical technology companies, including Edwards Lifesciences , Quest Diagnostics , Thermo Fisher and Roche Diagnostics have reported impacts on their first-quarter results as countries shifted resources away from routine testing and elective procedures to meet the growing demands of managing COVID-19. Johnson & Johnson saw medical device revenues fall 8.2% in the first quarter as a result of the pandemic, while Abbott said COVID-19 hit sales of its core diagnostics, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, and Intuitive Surgical reported a drop in da Vinci procedures in the latter half of March.
Meanwhile, Australian lawmakers are also looking to allow elective procedures to gradually resume in that country, including in vitro fertilisations, post-cancer procedures, such as breast reconstructions, joint replacements, eye procedures and endoscopies. Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said ""they'll start to be resumed on a sensible, safe and clinical needs-basis, to ensure we keep half an eye on the system in case there's any increase in COVID-19 numbers, while ensuring there's minimal risk to the patient and clinical staff.""",FAKE,FAKE

273,273," Chinas official death toll and infection numbers from a new coronavirus spiked dramatically on Thursday after authorities changed their counting methods, fuelling concern the epidemic is far worse than being reported.
Two top-ranking politicians overseeing the epicentre of the outbreak were also sacked, adding to questions over Chinas handling of the crisis, just hours after President Xi Jinping claimed positive results in battling the outbreak.
The World Health Organization also quickly countered Chinese reassurances that the epidemic, which has now officially killed more than 1,350 people in China, would peak in a matter of weeks.
I think its way too early to try to predict the beginning, the middle or the end of this epidemic right now, said Michael Ryan, head of WHOs health emergencies programme.
The virus has had massive ramifications globally since emerging from the central Chinese province of Hubei last month, with many countries banning travellers from China in a bid to stop people spreading the disease.
In Hubei, where tens of millions of people are trapped as part of an unprecedented quarantine effort, 242 new deaths were reported on Thursday.
Another 14,840 people were confirmed to be infected with the virus, with the new cases and deaths by far the biggest one-day increases since the crisis began.
The jumps raised the death toll to 1,355 and the total number of nationwide infections of the virus  officially named COVID-19  to nearly 60,000.
Hubei authorities said the huge increases were because they had broadened their definition for cases to include people clinically diagnosed via lung imaging.
Up until now, authorities had been documenting cases using a more sophisticated laboratory test.
The commission said it looked into past suspected cases and revised their diagnoses, suggesting that older cases were included in Thursdays numbers.
About 56 million people in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, are being banned from leaving as part of the quarantine efforts.
Tens of millions of others cities far from the epicentre are also enduring travel restrictions.
China had been praised by the World Health Organization for its transparent handling of the outbreak, in contrast to the way it concealed the extent of the deadly SARS virus epidemic in 2002-2003.
But it has faced continued scepticism among the global public, and US officials have also called for more openness from Chinas Communist Party rulers, leading to fears that there may be similarities with the way it dealt with SARS.
Authorities in Hubei have been accused of concealing the gravity of the outbreak in late December and early January.
The death of an infected doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the outbreak in December, but was silenced by authorities, triggered an outpouring of anger in China.
On Thursday, the leaders of Hubei and Wuhan were sacked, the highest-profile political scalps of the crisis.
Hubeis two top health officials had already been sacked this week.
Analysts said Hubeis new methodology to count infections might be for medical reasons and could be because Xi wants officials to be more transparent, but the immediate impact was to sow more distrust.
Oddly, this now is a moment of greater transparency, Sam Crane, political science professor at Williams College in Massachusetts, told AFP.
It is not clear if the problem up to now, on this issue, was lack of transparency or simply bad medical practice, Crane said.
Yun Jiang, a China researcher at Australian National University, said the new methodology may be a practical measure because Hubei has a shortage of laboratory testing kits.
I dont think the numbers are necessarily manipulated for political purposes but the numbers themselves may not be so trustworthy, Yun told AFP.
The biggest cluster of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off Japans coast, where 44 more people tested positive for COVID-19, raising the total number of infections on the Diamond Princes to 218.
Several countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have halted flights to and from the country, as hundreds of people have now been infected in some two dozen countries.

Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) epidemiologists and infectious disease experts are following the fast-evolving development of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of January 30, there are more than 7,900 cases, more than 98 percent of which are in mainland China.
We have offered support to health authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong, who are leading the respective response efforts, and offering support similar to what we did in 2003 during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndome (SARS), caused by a related type of coronavirus. These activities included training of health care staff on methods to prevent and control infections and health education for vulnerable and at-risk groups.
An MSF team is being deployed to Hong Kong with an initial focus on health education for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and other at-risk people.
Because the 2019-nCoV virus is new, much remains to be understood about it. However, as with other coronaviruses, droplet infection seems to be the main mode of transmission, so infection control measures such as handwashing and cough etiquette (covering coughs with disposable tissues or clothing) remain very important for prevention.",TRUE,FAKE
276,276,"This is an interesting topic that I enjoy thinking about with my curiosity about science. For a while, I have noted that our viruses are getting stronger and stronger. So is the bacteria. While we are busy worrying about our money and ways to accrue millions we forgot about a very important thing.
That is, of course, keeping up with the various strains of viruses that try to kill us.
 I am a believer in a higher power of some sort. Something bigger and much more all-powerful than myself. It keeps me humble and grounded.
 I think that I have discussed before my beliefs which are fairly neutral as far as religion goes. Like I said I believe in a higher power. Religion is another story altogether. I prefer to break down barriers and treat everyone as equals whereas religious dogma only serves to create barriers and segregate us. I think that this is part of a much larger problem and one that I do not have the time or the patience to explain at the moment. Suffice to say that if there is a religious god as various people believe then why are there so many things on this planet that are designed to wipe us out? I mean seriously think about that for a moment say nothing of the cosmos which could end our existence in the blink of an eye very much like it did with the dinosaurs.
 While I do not think that the Corona Virus is the horseman of the apocalypse I do think that it is another stern warning that we are losing the battle to disease. How long will it be before we see a virus that wipes out two-thirds of the worlds population like various plagues of the past?
 While I do not have the answer to that I suspect that it won't be long in coming if this is any sign how seriously we take this matter.
 On the market side of things, we have to, first of all, be aware of who first goosed the markets to their levels, to begin with, and who controls the price action of most markets now.
 Most of you know who that entity is at the moment without too much detail. Of course, I am talking about the central banks of the world. In short, they still have control and they will not likely lose it over this virus even if it means ending flights to various countries. Yes, it may slow things down for a small period of time but it won't have any black swan event repercussions on any of the markets. After all the central banks don't have the virus so why would we worry about them losing control.
 After all the worrying and drama, the trade will continue as always. The sun will rise and set as it always has and the human race will move forward. Bonds will continue to be bought by central banks and the debt will continue to be expanded forever and ever amen.
 The Coronavirus will come and go as SARS did and all the other viruses before it. People will die (generally the old, young and very weak which is the law of nature) and we will talk about it in the not too distant future as the ""outbreak of 2020"".
 It might be a good wake up call for our biological scientists and for governments to get more funding into this area before we actually do get a virus that runs amuck. In business and monetary sense it doesn't do anyone any good to have lots of money if you don't have your health, you are dead or your clients are dead.
 While we concentrate our focus on the unfortunate fate of a guy who put a ball in the hoop for a living, perhaps after we say our sad farewell, that we can turn our attention to more prying matters of moving ahead as a species. Stay invested and stay healthy. Cheers!",TRUE,FAKE

287,287,"On January 28, 2020, Lieber [Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor] was arrested on charges of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Defense and to Harvard investigators regarding his participation in China's Thousand Talents Program. The program was created to bribe American scientists and researchers to provide their research to China. In addition, his house was raided by the FBI. Wouldn't surprise me if Lieber was up to no good, as a Jew --Dr. Zack--was behind the post-9.11 Anthrax attacks. Dr. Zack was treated with kid gloves while Dr. Hatfill was hounded relentlessly, an attack aided by the (((MSM))) . The FBI, finally realizing they had fucked up--AGAIN--dropped the investigation,which allowed Hatfill to sue their sorry asses.
Dr. Zack left Fort Detrick in December 1991 amid allegations of unprofessional conduct. The Jewish scientist and others were accused of harassing their co-worker, Dr. Ayaad Assaad, until the Egyptian-born American scientist quit, according to an article in Connecticuts The Hartford Courant, the countrys oldest newspaper in continuous publication. Dr. Assaad sued the Army, claiming discrimination after Zacks badgering.
Although Dr. Zack was let go, he returned frequently to visit friends, and used the Fort Detrick laboratories for off-the-books work after hours. After reports of missing biological specimensincluding anthrax, Ebola and the simian AIDs viruscame to light, as well as reports of unauthorized research, a review of surveillance camera tapes recorded Dr. Zack entering the lab late on the night of Jan. 23, 1992, according to The Hartford Courant report. He was let in that night by Marian Rippy, a lab pathologist and close friend of Zacks, although she now says she has no memory of the evening. She did say that Zack occasionally visited and that other friends let him in. A Jew badgering an Arab? Say it ain't so!
Oh BTW, Zack is a Zionist.
FBI Closes in on Anthrax Terrorist
Prime Suspect is a Zionist by Hector Carreon
La Voz de Aztlan
Los Angeles, Alta California - 2/26/2002 - (ACN) Jewish microbiologist Dr. Philip M. Zack may be behind the deadly anthrax contaminated letters that were mailed to NBC's Tom Brokaw, Senator Tom Daschle and others, according to FBI sources. In a rapidly unravelling investigation by the FBI, it appears that the ""Arab-hating-Jew"" was behind a vile conspiracy to frame a colleague who was born in Egypt and who worked, along with Dr. Zack , at the U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Md. ""Death to America and Death to Israel?"" Did they also leave behind their passport? Go to Lieber's web site, ""Lieber Research Group"" and you'll find he's in bed with some very strange and dangerous people...
Try as I might, couldn't find specific info on Lieber's heritage, but Harvard is one of the Jewiest university's in the USA. 55% of the graduates are Juden.
And Lieber is a certified Jew surname. Plus, the president of Harvard's mother is an Awwshitz graduate. So many survivors, just who in the hell did those nasty Nazis kill?
Harvard department chair, BU researcher charged with concealing ties to China
Federal authorities on Tuesday discussed three cases in which researchers affiliated with Boston-area institutions are accused of trying to provide clandestine scientific aid to the People's Republic of China.
""This is a small sample of China's ongoing campaign to siphon off American technology and know-how for Chinese gain,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said during a press conference at the Moakley Federal Courthouse. The chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard University, Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, is accused of lying to federal authorities about his ties to China and was arrested Tuesday, officials announced.
""China's Thousand Talents Plan, according to the complaint (is) a Chinese government-run program designed to entice scientists and researchers in the United States to share their research expertise with China,"" said Lelling. ""China's ongoing campaign to siphon off American technology..?"" The dummies should of gotten an Israeli front man/woman. If they had, this story would of never came to light.
Why lie about consulting with China? Unless there's much more to this story.
On the other hand, maybe it's just a simple case of that Jew superiority thing, where they're always lording it over us GOYIM about how smart they are, so when some farm animal Goyim dare to ask His Highness some questions, it's the Jews right to lie.
After all, we're just dumbass animals here to serve the Jews, as many a Rabbi will tell you.

And now: 2019 nCoV?
Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? said Trevor Hoppe, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, who has studied the history of disease names.
The name, which stands for 2019 novel coronavirus , has been assigned to the virus behind the outbreak of flu-like illnesses that started in China late last year.
Scientists are still learning about the new virus, so it's hard to come up with a good name, Hoppe said. The current one is likely temporary, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Once people have a chance to catch their breath, it might be changed,\"" Messonnier said.
Many media outlets have been skipping the clunky 2019 nCoV and just calling it the new virus or new coronavirus, which isn't very specific. Coronavirus is the umbrella term for a large group of viruses , including the one that causes the common cold.
Since the outbreak is centered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, others have been using Wuhan virus or Wuhan coronavirus or even Wuhan flueven though flu is an entirely different virus.
It's consistent with a centuries-old tradition of naming new ailments after cities, countries, or regions of the world where they first popped up. West Nile was first detected in the West Nile district of Uganda; Lyme disease in Old Lyme, Conn.; and Ebola in a village near Africa's Ebola River.
But that can sometimes be wrong or misleading. The 1918 pandemic was called Spanish flu, though researchers don't think Spain is where it actually started.
Now we have a much different sensibility and tolerance about how we refer to things, said Dr. Howard Markel , a medical historian at the University of Michigan.
In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines that discouraged the use of geographic locations (like Zika virus), animals (swine flu), or groups of people (Legionnaires' disease).
Hoppe noted that AIDS, when it first emerged in the early 1980s, was called gay-related immune deficiency.\"" That was dropped as it became clear that heterosexuals were also spreading the virus. AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
With the guidelines, WHO was trying to bring an end to unnecessary stigma that could ostracize people and damage business. Demand for pork plunged in 2009 with so-called swine flu, first identified in a boy who lived on a pig farm in Mexicoeven though it wasn't spread through eating pork.
Markel said he liked when diseases were named after the scientists who first described them. (Think Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Tourette.) That was once common but may be more problematic today with scientists across the world working on a new ailment at the same time.
As for the new virus, I can see why they want to name it something generic but it has to be something people use, he said. Otherwise the easier name will take over, and it's naive to think otherwise.\""
In the end, the WHO may have little control over what it's called, he added.
'Wuhan virus' is very catchyno pun intended,\"" Markel said. It's a very contagious name.

303,303,"The UK is investigating a number of suspected cases, while officials there are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have recently flown to the UK from Hubei province. The virus has also now spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France.
What is Coronavirus The name for this kind of virus comes from the crownlike spikes it has on its surface  corona is Latin for crown. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
How does it spread Like other coronaviruses  such as the common cold  the virus is spread via droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread when someone touches a contaminated surface such as a door handle.
Hospitals are also key locations for super spreading events  when a single patient infects many people. When patients arrive in hospital with vague respiratory symptoms health workers may not know they need to take special precautions such as wearing masks or keeping them away from other patients.
The outbreak originates from animals and the source is thought to be a seafood market in Wuhan which also traded in other live animals such as marmots and bats.
How to prevent Coronavirus There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway. The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus, but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available.
You may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds. Awareness is key.
If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.If traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid living in animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan.
Symptoms of Coronavirus The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.
Three to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO, it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure.
Treatment of Coronavirus Though there are potential therapeutics but there are no specific treatments for coronaviruses  just as there is no treatment for the common cold.
Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, at the Centre of Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford, said the disease bore all the signs of a classic viral pneumonia.
There are currently no antivirals for this, so care is just supportive, supporting the lungs and other organs until patients recover, he said.
There are other potential therapeutics out there but no effective antiviral, he added.",TRUE,FAKE

It is also easy to pass the virus on to others, just by breathing, using patients tools, or touching contaminated surfaces. 12 days incubation Front-line doctors at the epidemic from Jinentan Hospital in Wuhan said that the incubation period of the Corona Virus is 12 days, which means that the virus will pass from the infected person to others without the patients knowledge. According to BBC. The initial symptoms are similar to the common flu, such as sneezing, coughing, sinus obstruction, and high fever. However, it is not possible for the patient to distinguish between corona and regular influenza, through the apparent symptoms only, but it requires microscopic blood tests and serological tests. The first victim According to the doctors at the Jintin Hospital in Wuhan, the first patients dying of the disease appeared to be in good health. But the two have been smokers for many years, which may mean that the lungs of both of them were really tired. The first casualty was a 61-year-old man, who was suffering from severe pneumonia upon arrival at the hospital. The man was suffering from severe shortness of breath, which means that his lungs were unable to deliver enough oxygen to his body to survive. Despite being placed on a ventilator, his lungs and heart stopped working. The man or the woman? Recent figures indicate that there is more gender parity in the infection. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the infection rate is 1.2 men per 1.0 women. Men may be more likely to contract the disease in a severe manner, which requires their transfer to hospital.

Some extreme cases involve patients coughing up blood or going into septic shock, Foreign Policy reports. More typically, however, symptoms remain milder  potentially letting some cases slip under the radar and worsening the outbreak.
Like other coronaviruses, 2019-nCoV can cause pneumonia and other respiratory and cardiovascular conditions: coughing, fever, fatigue, and soreness. Because the outbreak is in the middle of flu season, FP reports, that can make distinguishing between the two difficult.
As the disease progresses, it can cause more severe symptoms including difficulty breathing, kidney injury, and heart damage.
The virus is most dangerous for the elderly or people who are already sick  the mortality rate is substantially higher within those particular groups than the general population, according to FP.
Screening for new cases is also difficult because 2019-nCoV patients can spread the disease while they remain asymptomatic for as long as two weeks  compared to most viral infections which cause symptoms within the first few days. History and Recent Advances in Coronavirus Discovery Human coronaviruses, first characterized in the 1960s, are responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections in children. Since 2003, at least 5 new human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which caused significant morbidity and mortality. NL63, representing a group of newly identified group I coronaviruses that includes NL and the New Haven coronavirus, has been identified worldwide. These viruses are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are likely common human pathogens. The global distribution of a newly identified group II coronavirus, HKU1, has not yet been established. Coronavirology has advanced significantly in the past few years. The SARS epidemic put the animal coronaviruses in the spotlight. The background and history relative to this important and expanding research area are reviewed here. Newsworthiness is Defined In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered newsworthy has met different definitions, such as the notion of news values.

Intel withdrew its full-year sales forecast, citing significant economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic . The companys shares fell more than 5 per cent in late trading. The worlds largest semiconductor maker reported a 23 per cent jump in first-quarter revenue and better-than-projected profit, bolstered by demand for chips that run the laptops and server machines companies need to keep people working from home. Though it gave an optimistic second-quarter sales target, Intels profit outlook fell short of estimates, sparking concerns that a spending slowdown will drag on business for the rest of 2020. Sales in the current period will be about US$18.5 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated US$18.08 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income will be about US$1.04 a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of US$1.11. Investors were caught off guard by the profit forecast, Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co., said. When theyre crushing it on the top line but whiffing pretty hard on the earnings, its a shock. Companies have reacted to coronavirus shelter-in-place orders by buying more laptops to keep employees working remotely. At the same time, data centre owners have responded to a surge in videoconferencing, social-media use and movie streaming by stocking up on pricey Intel processors that run server machines. Those trends fuelled a 14 per cent increase in PC-related chip sales in the first quarter, and a 43 per cent gain in the companys data centre division. Intel, Lenovo and BGI are working to crack the coronavirus genome Still, the soaring first-quarter sales fed into concerns that demand may have peaked early in the year, with Intel and its customers girding for the worst recession since the 2008 financial crisis. In the report, the chip maker said it expects weaker demand from government and corporate clients in the second half of 2020. The second half demand picture is more uncertain, chief executive officer Bob Swan said during a conference call with analysts. For Intels PC chip business, the economic slowdown will outweigh demand from the work-from-home trend, the company said. The data centre division will benefit from continued chip purchases by large cloud providers, it added. The company suspended share repurchases in late March and did not reinstate buy-backs on Thursday. It also sold US$10 billion of debt recently to give itself a financial cushion if needed, chief financial officer George Davis said in an interview following the results. At some point were going to see the recession start to impact demand for PCs, Davis told analysts on the conference call. Intel is already seeing the impact on automotive customers and the Internet-of-Things business, he added. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, will suffer in the second quarter as Intel increases production of new chips. That will be reversed when those products go on sale in the second half, he said. First-quarter sales climbed to US$19.8 billion, the chip maker said. Analysts on average had predicted US$18.83 billion. Net income was US$5.7 billion, or US$1.31 a share, compared with per-share estimates for US$1.23. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, widened to 60.6 per cent in the quarter. Intel shares, which closed at US$59.04 in New York, dropped as low as US$55.26 following the earnings report. The stock is down about 1 per cent for 2020.",FAKE,FAKE

355,355,"A week ago, we published details that raised questions about the source of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, specifically questioning the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market as a fabricated farce.
The real reason behind the viral spread, we suggested, was that a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada ) , was released by Wuhan's Institute of Virology (presumably accidentally ) , China's only top, level-4 biohazard lab, which was studying "" the world's most dangerous pathogens .""
At the time we summarized the series of dots and asked ""real reporters"" to connect them: One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp . Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world. His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ( such as the STING pathway in bats ) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.
Of course, that is all ancient history and Zero Hedge was permanently banned from Twitter for raising such a conspiracy theory about a publicly-searchable person working a publicly-searchable place.
But, bygones being bygones, we moved on... until today when no lesser entity than The White House began asking questions about the origin of the deadly coronavirus.
As ABC News reports, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts ""rapidly"" look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and ""to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.""
Specifically, ABC News' Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about concerns that stem from misinformation online that the novel coronavirus could have been engineered or deliberately released .
""There's always that concern ,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said.
""And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there's even any possibility much less likelihood that that's going on . And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.""
The White House has good reason to question the official story as evolutionary biologist Dr. James Lyons-Weiler of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge , showed and explained how the coronavirus' genetic sequence - which has been publicly released by China - contains a unique ""middle fragment"" encoding a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spike protein that appears, according to his genomic analysis, to have been inserted into the 2019-nCoV virus using ""pShuttle"" technology. This technique can only be done in a lab, as it has never occurred naturally in nature.
This isn't a 'conspiracy theory', it is a scientific, medical theory, says Del Bigtree, the Emmy-winning producer and founder of non-profit Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).
Its foundation is based on sound science, logic, and research, and the mainstream media needs to be asked whether it is going to pursue this link to SARS instead of trying to censor anyone who is trying to pursue truth via scientific fact .
One additional, major reason we suspect this line of logical reasoning could be correct - as conspiratorial as it may seem - is that Chinese authorities have launched a full-scale crusade to disprove the fact that this deadly virus was man-made.
""Conspiracy theorists don't believe in science. I hope that the national professional department will investigate and give us an innocence,"" Shi Zhengli, a director at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China - responded to Caixin on February 4.
Faced with external doubts and accusations, on February 2nd, Shi Zhengli responded angrily in the WeChat circle of friends:
"" The new coronavirus in 2019 is a punishment for uncivilized living habits of human beings by nature . It doesn't matter. I advise those who believe and spread rumours of bad media, believe in the so-called academic analysis that Indian scholars do not rely on, and close your mouth. ""
Additionally, as The Washington Times reports, one ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is the that false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.
That could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhans civilian or defense research laboratories .
As a reminder, it was discovered that Shi Zhengli had participated in a study published in Natural Medicine on November 9, 2015, about a disease that can be caused by a SARS-like coronavirus (SHC014-CoV) found in Chinese horseshoe bats .
The researchers used the SARS reverse genetics system to generate and identify a chimeric virus. In simple terms, this chimeric virus consists of the surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of the SARS virus. The chimeric virus can infect human respiratory cells, demonstrating that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to key receptors on cells and infect cells. Chimeras can cause disease in mice, but they are not lethal. Studies have shown that viruses currently circulating in bat populations could potentially trigger the potential risk of SARS-CoV (SARS virus) outbreaks .
We are sure this is all just a coincidence - Wuhan epicenter... Only P4 facility in China... A lab investigating bats infected with genetically engineered Coronavirus... Coronavirus infected Bats... Chimeric bio-engineered viruses.... and that is probably why The White House is now asking authorities to investigate the source of the disease.
Of course, when Zero Hedge suggested the same thing, highlighting key personnel in the Wuhan lab that were publicly acknowledged as responsible for that research, we were immediately banned by Twitter. We look forward to reading Buzzfeed's article decrying The White House for daring to ask questions about the origin of this deadly pandemic.",FAKE,TRUE

363,363,"In a conversation over breakfast, a priest was telling us about an incident that happened on the bus as he was coming home from the university. A Chinese-looking man came into the bus which was pretty crowded. At the next stop, an Italian lady went-off the bus, and she was loudly declaring that the Chinese guy should also get-off because he might spread the Corona virus.
The poor guy just stood in silence, even as all the people in the bus was staring at him. According to the priest, he was not sure if the guy noticed the people looking at him, if he understood Italian, or if he was even Chinese. This is not the first time this has happened. Another Filipina related a similar story of how people consciously avoided her in the bus, just because she looks Chinese.
The Corona virus has stoked a lot of fears and prejudice. Those who looks oriental, even if they are Japanese, Korean or Filipino, are unfairly subjected to stereotypical discrimination. How much worse if they suddenly cough or sneeze in public. These are yet isolated cases, because there is still a large majority who does not care about the Corona virus, but they serve as a warning.
Personally I have been warned, because here in Rome, there have been many occasions when I have been mistaken for a Korean or Chinese. I do have a great-great-grandfather who is pure Chinese, so it is not so improbable that I may found myself in a similar situation. I am not worried about this, but I do care, because I have read a few articles saying that the Corona virus has allowed a lot of anti-Chinese sentiments to surface in the Philippines.
I understand that many have Filipinos have grievances against China, especially given the issues surrounding the West Philippine Sea. Some may have business or personal issues, and it is easy to hate on all Chinese in general. This is racial discrimination and if we are followers of Christ, we should check ourselves because we might be allowing our anger and hatred to govern our attitudes and decisions.
The Corona virus has caused suffering. We are not spared from this suffering, and we are tempted to be anxious, to panic and to strike out. Sadly, we only look to our own discomfort, and we dont care that there are people who suffer more than us. Then we justify our irrational anger and hate by saying that those who suffer deserve it that it is a punishment from God for all the injustice that they have done to us.
If there is a better time to remember that we are Christians, it is in situations like this. Let us remind ourselves that the greatest commandment is to love, even to those whom we consider our enemies. Let us express this love even in simple kindness and charity towards our neighbors, especially in our personal relationships. Let us not allow the Corona virus to bring out the worst in us.",FAKE,FAKE

380,380,"Xenophobia, ideology and the Western fear for Chinas rise are the triple burdens that hinder the fight against the 2019 coronavirus (nCov).
Recently, Kevin Rudd, former Australian prime minister and president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York, wrote: The wider world should show sympathy and express solidarity with the long-suffering Chinese people.
These are ugly times and the racism implicit (and sometimes explicit) in many responses to Chinese people around the world makes me question just how far we have really come as a human family.
Rudds people-centred global approach in the fight against coronavirus resonates with a well-known African idiom, Inxeba lendoda alihlekwa, used among the Nguni dialects, which simply means: The wound of a man is not laughed at.
In reporting on the coronavirus, The Wall Street Journal carried an article by Bard College Professor Walter Russell Mead, titled China is the Real Sick Man of Asia.
The professor and newspaper are well aware that the term sick man of Asia is a derogatory phrase that emanates from Chinas century of humiliation at the hands of Western and Japanese powers.
Xenophobic tendencies against Chinese people have spread globally mainly through social media which constantly portrays the virus as having been caused by Chinese peoples eating habits.
The second frontal attack against the attempts by the Chinese authorities to speedily conquer the virus are cloaked in ideological clothes. There have been numerous opinion pieces in the Western media that are using the virus outbreak to directly attack President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party. The main aim of such attacks are twofold: firstly, to advance the long-held view that liberal democracies handle and manage epidemics and general crises much better than what is considered as an authoritarian regime. The weakness of such an argument lies in the fact it is ahistorical. The US itself is littered with mismanagement of crises confronted by its people.
The Guardian newspaper in the UK carried an article by Emma Graham-Harrison on January 31,which argued: China soon won international plaudits for a huge mobilisation, including the near impossible feat of building two new hospitals in as many weeks yet as information about the early days of the outbreak has slowly filtered out of China, it has become increasingly clear that the same political system that allowed Beijing to order such a dramatic response, also initially allowed the virus to foster.
Lastly, the Western media and US officials use the coronavirus as a tool to limit the rise of China.
On January 24, a leading magazine in the US, Foreign Policy, unashamedly carried an article titled Welcome to the Belt and Road Pandemic.
Author Laurie Garrett wrote: By making the Belt and Road Initiative endeavour - a multitrillion-dollar programme to expand Chinese trade and infrastructure around the world - the epicentre of his foreign and economic policy, Xi has made it possible for a local disease to become a global menace.
At this juncture, theres a need to build a united front in combating the spread of the disease and finding a cure. Africa has worked tirelessly with China within FOCAC on communicative diseases.
Hence it is important for Africa and China to double their efforts to manage the coronavirus. Africa has responded soberly to the outbreak without causing unnecessary panic on the markets and among its people. More efforts ought to be taken to strengthen Africas healthworkers response.
But this can be done showing ubuntu, rejecting the triple burdens in the fight against the disease - xenophobia, ideological differences and the fear of Chinas rise.",FAKE,FAKE

In response to this situation, and immediately after the occurrence of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, BGI sequenced the genome of the new 2019-nCoV virus and successfully developed a Real-Time (RT) Fluorescent PCR (polymerase chain reaction) kit for detecting 2019-nCoV, which can provide results in a few hours and has already obtained approval by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration. In addition to the rapid detection kit based on RT-PCR technology, the DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform developed by the BGI Group company MGI passed the emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, becoming the first officially approved testing products in China for surveillance, discovery and identification of unknown infectious diseases. In Europe, BGI and MGI will work with their long-term strategic partner Ares Genetics to make its 2019-nCoV testing portfolio available to public health institutions and hospitals for outbreak monitoring, infection control, and epidemiology. Ares Genetics expects to provide next-generation sequencing services for 2019-nCoV out of its NGS laboratory in Vienna Austria for infection control and tracking of pathogen evolution from February 2020 onwards based on MGIs DNBSEQ sequencing platform. Further, Ares Genetics and the Curetis Group will support BGI Group in the distribution of its PCR and NGS reagent kits to molecular testing laboratories in Europe that have the capability for 2019-nCoV testing with reagent kits initially being marketed for research use only prior to regulatory approval in Europe. Ares Genetics is a digital diagnostics company utilizing artificial intelligence-powered molecular diagnostics to advance the field of infectious disease testing. Ares Genetics recently launched ARESupa  Universal Pathogenome Assay for the broad identification of bacterial pathogens and the accurate prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. The ARESupa test is based on the sequencing of bacterial DNA, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. The first generation of ARESupa is currently offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) for human diagnostic use is under development. The ability to rapidly test for 2019-nCoV with PCR as well as track its evolution by next-generation sequencing is key to contain this global outbreak. While Ares Genetics specializes in molecular detection of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility prediction, we are responding to the global coronavirus health threat via our specialized molecular service laboratory and making 2019-nCoV testing broadly available in Europe under our strategic partnership with BGI. commented Dr. Andreas Posch, Managing Director and CEO of Ares Genetics, Longer-term, we anticipate that adding viruses to the scope for ARESupa will also significantly augment its utility as an aid in the differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections. ###
About ARESupa Universal Pathogenome Assay Information on antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens is of utmost importance for clinical practice, epidemiology and public health purposes as well as for the development of pharmaceutical products in the infectious disease sector. Ares Genetics therefore has developed a molecular Antibiotic Susceptibility Test (AST) that is marketed under the brand name ARESupa  Universal Pathogenome Assay and is capable of accurately identifying microbial pathogens as well as predicting antibiotic susceptibility via artificial intelligence-powered interpretation of high-throughput DNA sequencing data obtained by next-generation sequencing technologies. ARESupa is based on whole-genome sequencing of bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. ARESdb covers genomes of about 40,000 bacterial strains and associated susceptibility data for more than 100 different antibiotics. ARESupa already today accurately detects antibiotic susceptibility broadly across drug/pathogen combinations with prediction algorithms for further drug/pathogen combinations in development. The test is initially offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) on native patient samples for human diagnostic use in indications in which current culture-based diagnostic practice is inherently challenging is planned. Furthermore, Ares Genetics has recently entered into a multi-phase strategic partnership with an undisclosed leading global in vitro diagnostics corporation to jointly develop diagnostic solutions for infectious disease testing based on the ARESupa.

405,405,"A Pearl River County man is recovering at home after spending three weeks on a ventilator due to COVID-19. Doctors didnt believe there was much chance for survival, but the man and his family never gave up hope.
After 21 days on a ventilator, Joey Collum was wheeled out of a Hattiesburg hospital.
Lord. I dont even know how to put that into words, Collum said. I knew then I was way more blessed than I ever thought I was.
Emergency responders escorted Collum and his wife Datia from the hospital to their church where a welcome committee awaited.
They had their sirens going down the highway and he was just crying. He was just crying. Because he made it. He made it, Datia said.
Datia says, according to doctors, the odds were against him. The 62-year-old Mississippi man has pre-existing conditions and hadn't fully recovered from a recent bout in the hospital.
""The doctors weren't giving me a whole lot of hope. They were already basically preparing me for the worst,"" Datia explained. ""The virus just basically tore his lungs up.""
Joey first showed symptoms, March 22. By the 27, he was in the hospital with pneumonia. The next day, Joeys test came back positive for COVID-19. His condition had deteriorated and he was flown to a hospital in Hattiesburg where he only got worse.
He was in such bad condition. I got the phone call after they intubated him which means that the last time I talked to him wouldve been the last time that I talked to him had anything happened. So, I was just feeling a little lost, Datia choked back tears. Im sorry.
When doctors put Joey on a ventilator, Datia did research on mortality rates for COVID patients, looking for hope but finding very little.
A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates nine out of 10 COVID patients put on ventilators do not survive. The study examined the outcomes of 2,600 patients in the New York City area.
Doctors say, the longer a patient is on one, the less chance for survival. Ventilators help a patient breathe but do not offer a solution. They solely provide support until the body is well enough to breathe on its own or until other treatments prove successful.
""It was scary. It was really scary because he almost didn't make it,"" Datia said.
For days, Datia waited for good news, but it didn't come. She tried to stay busy and stay strong for her family. Oftentimes, Datia says she found herself outside, singing and talking to her God.
""If it was his time to go, then God knows better than me what plan he had. I was able to keep my faith just because of the relationship I have with God and that he has our best interest in mind and I just had to trust him and believe that,"" explained Datia.
It wasn't. Joey began to improve and doctors took him off a ventilator.
21 days. I didnt even know I was alive, Joey said.
Once Joey awoke from sedation and started responding, Datia knew her husband would recover.
""It was a very weak and a very frail voice but he told me he loved me and it was perfect. It might've been weak but it was perfect,"" recalled Datia.
Still celebrating but exhausted from the homecoming, the Collums believe it would have never happened without their faith.
We had a lot of people praying and so I really believe that those prayers were heard, Datia said. And hes home.
""I know my God never let my hand go,"" Joey said.
Joey is still recovering. He doesnt have his voice back, completely, and there are sores on his face from the glue that held the intubation tube in place.

409,409," The city turned into a ghost town after the restrictions imposed on inbound tourists (Paulo Coutinho, MDT)
The local governments protection measures against the 2019-nCoV outbreak will have a strong effect on Macaus cash flow, a report by Fitch Ratings released today (Friday) says.
The cash flow effect is particularly strong concerning the citys gaming operators. However, the gaming operators are still said to be able to resist this crisis due to their firm credit backgrounds.
According to the statistics released by Macaus Public Security Force, Macau has recorded, on a daily basis, a decrease of over 80% in the number of visitor arrivals since January 24 (the last day before the beginning of the lunar new year).
Currently, in Macau, there are four US-listed gaming issuers: LVS, Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International and Melco Resorts & Entertainment.
The adequate liquidity of these four US issuers is said to be capable of making them withstand the historically high decrease in visitor arrivals, which in turns creates potential FCF effects.
Between January 24 and January 30, Macau recorded less than 150,000 visitor arrivals from mainland China, an accumulated decrease of 83.3%. On January 30 alone, a decrease of 92.6% was recorded, with only 9,664 mainland visitors arriving in Macau.
As of September 30 of 2019, around 64% of LVSs, 72% of Wynns, 22% of MGMs and 88% of Melcos consolidated property-level revenues are from Macau.
According to Fitch Ratings, the four US-listed issuers will have a total of USD20 billion in cash flow by the end of the second quarter of 2020 under the assumption that their revenue from Macau will decrease 50% and 25%, respectively, in the first and second quarters of 2020.
Despite the fact that the pandemic will not influence these issuers cash flow in the long-term, in the short-term however the issuers will suffer from a temporary cash flow impact assuming that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV will last no more than two quarters.",TRUE,FAKE

In a meeting with the mayors at the Capitol on Thursday, February 6, 2020, Governor Gwendolyn Garcia announced that the two-day tour in the four towns in Camotes Island will continue despite the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The question of whether or not Suroy Suroy Sugbo will push through was brought up as the issue on the suspension of activities that will gather huge crowds was taken up.
The Suroy Suroy Sugbo, a tour around the towns of Cebu, usually gathers hundreds of participants consisting of both local, balikbayans and foreigners.
In the Northern Escapade leg of Suroy-Suroy Sugbo last January 22 to 24, the tour was participated by 305 paying participants.

In a separate interview, Garcia said she will leave it up to the local chief executives of every town to decide whether or not they will suspend their activities.
The Municipality of Consolacion, for instance, suspended the celebration of its centennial founding anniversary amid the 2019-nCoV threat.
Meanwhile, Garcia has urged the local tourism enterprises, especially the hotels, to take the current low occupancy due to the 2019-nCoV threat as a chance to improve their facility.
Garcia said the hotels can renovate their rooms or improve other amenities so that when the health risk has settled and tourists start to come in again, they will have the advantage of having better things to offer.

The Canadian Centre for Child Protection is seeing an increase in talk among predators and a spike in activity on its tip line for reporting online sexual exploitation of children, said Signy Arnason, the centres associate executive director .
Theres no question that youre seeing an uptick  a significant uptick  in chatter related to taking advantage of COVID-19, Ms. Arnason said. Its really like a heyday for offenders.

Over one weekend in mid-April, the centre fielded 80 priority reports to the tip line, up from about 15 on any busy weekend before the pandemic, she said. Still, reports to the tip line dont capture the entire scope of the problem because many children dont know that their images have been stored and shared, she added.
A few days later, UNICEF issued a strong warning about the heightened risk of online sexual exploitation during a lockdown. The organization is urging technology companies to improve the safety features of their platforms and asking governments to step up awareness initiatives. Reports of child sexual exploitation to tip lines across the world have increased an average of 30 per cent amid the pandemic, according to InHope, a global network of cyber tip lines, as first reported by NBC News.
Online sexual exploitation can refer to children who are abused in their homes and then have images of the abuse distributed online, as well as children who are sexually exploited through online interactions.
Predators who attempt to collect nude images or sexual videos of children on livestreaming platforms  cappers, they call themselves  share techniques and encouragement within communities on the dark web, according to the centre.
In a typical scenario, a capper would target a boy using a bait video  often showing a girl undressing  using specialized software to give the boy the impression that he is livestreaming with a female peer rather than an adult male.
The predator would then direct the boy to perform sexual acts, recording the livestream for distribution online. Some predators will extort children for money or additional sexual images by threatening to release pictures and videos they already have online or to family and friends.
If you cant find a boy right now your catfish [bait] video either sucks or you have zero idea how to talk to teens, commented one predator recently in a dark web forum captured by the centre. Omegle has literally been bursting at the seams in the last 2 weeks with boys, wrote another, referring to a popular website for anonymous chatting.
Story continues below advertisement
Girls are more often targeted for sexual grooming, which can involve predators complimenting them and creating the illusion of a relationship, Ms. Arnason said.
A message for all children is that they should never appear nude on webcams or livestreams, she said.
Predators can reach children on well-known apps such as TikTok and Instagram, as well as gaming interfaces such as Roblox and Discord; websites such as Omegle; and apps such as Cake and Sarahah, which have been the focus of safety alerts from the centres tip line, Cybertip.ca.
Sergeant Arnold Guerin, who works in the technology section of the RCMPs National Child Exploitation Crime Centre, said his team is also tracking a rise in conversation among predators, who were gleeful and delighted about children having more screen time, often unsupervised.
He emphasized the importance of parents having conversations with their children about the internet and said that focusing on whether certain platforms are worse than others isnt particularly helpful.
What is more helpful advice is to be really involved in your childs online community, Sgt. Guerin said. Its okay to go to your kids and say, Hey, I dont know anything about Snapchat. Can you tell me what a private story is?'"" (They can only be viewed by people the Snapchat user has selected.)
Story continues below advertisement
Children should not accept social media contacts and friend requests from strangers, Sgt. Guerin said, acknowledging that this is difficult for a lot of kids who want more likes on their content.
Staff Sergeant Sharon Hanlon, manager of the Ontario Provincial Polices Child Sexual Exploitation Unit, said a common issue is children doing stunts to get more likes, such as momentarily dropping their pants, not realizing how their images could later be used. (A spokeswoman for the Toronto Police Service, Meaghan Gray, said the forces child exploitation unit has noticed an increase in children voluntarily posting images that could be used by an adult for exploitative purposes.)
Staff Sgt. Hanlon recommended that families download a free resource called Understanding Child Sexual Abuse , which was created by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. An informed public is the best defence against the sexual exploitation of children, she added.
In 2016, the centre launched Project Arachnid, a platform that automatically searches, or crawls, links reported to the centres tip line and sends notices to technology companies to remove identified child sexual abuse material. Last year, the centre received about 35,000 reports to its tip line and sent more than 1.3 million removal notifications to electronic service providers.
In early March, five countries, including the United States and Canada, released a set of 11 voluntary principles for technology companies to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse. They include calling on companies to prevent child sexual abuse material from being made available on their platforms, identify exploitation facilitated by livestreaming and introduce stronger safety mechanisms.
Though parents and guardians have an important role to play in prevention, Ms. Arnason said the notion that they can know everything their kids are doing online is ludicrous.

It allows industry to get off the hook for the fact that they have not put in place the measures that are needed, she said.
Online sexual exploitation of children can be reported to Cybertip.ca, Canadas national tip line. Information about a child who is in immediate danger should be reported to 911.

Xinchang County is located in Zhejiang province, and Zhejiang province is one of the most severely virus hit provinces with already 1006 patients confirmed 2019-nCoV diagnose as of Feb. 6th. At present, it is in a tense period of national epidemic prevention and control. In order to respond to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, Antwork actively contacts with local hospitals, supports epidemic prevention with practical actions, fully cooperates with local governments and medical related units, and escorts the timely and rapid delivery of medical samples and protection materials through the deployment of its drone transportation network. During the epidemic prevention and control period, Antwork took the initiative to take drone RA3 and tr7s as well as unmanned station RH1 as the technical solution, to do the transportation of medical samples and quarantine materials between Xinchang County Peoples Hospital, Xinchang County disease control center and Dashiju branch of Xinchang County Peoples hospital. In this operation, the air delivery system provided by Antwork is adopted. Its automatic and unmanned operation mode can significantly reduce the contact opportunities between samples and personnel in the transportation process, and improve the delivery speed. At the same time, the Antwork branch company (Aerodeli), which undertakes this operation task, has obtained the worlds first urban drone delivery license issued by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last October. The sample delivery work will be carried out in strict accordance with the certified operation procedures, which can ensure the safety of medical samples in the transportation process. Take off and landing point of disease control center of Xinchang County
In the actual transportation process, the flight efficiency of drone has increased by more than 50% compared with the ordinary road transportation, which provides an efficient means of transportation for the epidemic prevention and control. At the same time, with more and more medical staff and ambulance being transferred to the front line, in the case of extreme personnel shortage, the use of drone transportation can also save human and material resources to the greatest extent. In addition, using drone to transport materials can effectively avoid secondary pollution of medical materials.As soon as the news of Wuhan blocking came out on January 23, Antwork immediately contacted the health and disease control departments of various regions, and took the initiative to petition for the technical support of drone air transportation for the front-line medical institutions fighting against the epidemic. After the project of Xinchang peoples hospital is put into operation, Antwork will also actively assist more medical institutions around the nation to deploy air transport services and contribute a technical force to the anti-epidemic!",TRUE,TRUE

444,444,"A disease epidemic with the potential for pandemic proportions is upon us again. Unlike the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) which caught Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea off guide, there is a worldwide alarm on the emergence of a coronavirus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV), aptly named after the Chinese city of its origin, is a respiratory illness that has so far caused 26 deaths and 830 cases and rising across China, according to the New York Times reporting. There has been confirmed cases of the disease in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States.
The Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) belongs to the same family of diseases as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease is known to circulate among animals. However, there is a high likelihood that the disease has evolved thus spreading between people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Chinese health authorities are reporting that the virus is adapting and mutating. That is, the virus is changing itself to suit its environment/host (the infected person).
The incubation period appears to be similar to those of SARS and MERS. For now, CDC researchers suggest that infected persons appear to exhibit symptoms between 2 to 14 days. The symptoms are pneumonia-like and they include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Given Liberia's relationship with China and the ease with which people travel between the two countries, the virus poses a likely threat to Liberia. To mitigate the threat, Liberia must initiate the following as recommended by the CDC:
Establish, if it does not already exist, an incident management and emergency response system that will support any public health response to the outbreak of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Liberia.
Condition the population to revert to the same mindset and preparedness posture as was exhibited during the 2014 Ebola epidemic.
Stock up on face masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for medical staff in the event there is an outbreak.
Issue travel advisory to people traveling to southeast and south Asia that will include warnings such as:
- Avoid physical contact with people who may appear sick.
- Avoid contact with animals and uncooked meat.
- Wash your hands as often as you can with soap or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Cover nose and mouth when sneezing.",TRUE,FAKE
445,445,"Earlier today, Rabobanks Michael Every laid out succinctly the dilemma facing Beijing, when he said that China appears to have perhaps decided that the economic damage being wrought by a demand collapse and supply-chain shutdown is just too much to bear. As reported overnight, Xi Jinping stated that China will meet its economic goals AND win the battle vs. the virus, and Beijing is urging firms to increase output even as the capital itself is largely locked down  and other cities are physically locking people into their homes. Thats as even the US admits that the Phase One trade deal will be slow off the market due to the virus impact.
Of course, China is no stranger to Double Think: as Every put it, a freely-floating, controlled currency; market-determined, state-directed interest rates; and free-trade mercantilism. Yet increase economic activity from here and the virus will spread, both internally and globally. Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.
That, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw Chinas dialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis and concluded that things are going to get nasty for economies and markets  especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.
Today, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijings order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the companys 200+ employees couldnt go home and were immediately placed under quarantine. At least the workers managed to organize quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldnt go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves.

447,447,"A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.
Some types of them are serious, though. About 858 people have died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which first appeared in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula. In 2003, 774 people died from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS. MERS and SARS are types of coronaviruses.
But in early January 2020, the World Health Organization identified a new type: 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China. By late January, there were 300 confirmed cases in China and a death count that was still in the single digits, but rising. And despite airport screenings, a traveler had brought the first case to the U.S.
What Is a Coronavirus?
Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, but we don't know where they come from. They get their name from their crown-like shape. Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans.
Most coronaviruses spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do: through infected people coughing and sneezing, by touching an infected person's hands or face, or by touching things such as doorknobs that infected people have touched.
Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time.",TRUE,TRUE

On April 12, three Indian nationals residing in Birgunj had tested positive for Covid-19. They are at the isolation facility in Narayani hospital.
The new cases were reported just a day before the end of the national lockdown imposed since March 24 to contain the spread of the virus.
A Cabinet meeting scheduled today will decide on whether to extend the lockdown and the modality for it.
More than a month into lockdown, there have been calls from some sections to ease the lockdown by assessing the situation in the areas where more Covid-19 cases have been reported.
On Saturday, the Health Ministry had recommended extending lockdown by at least a week or allowing provincial governments to take a decision on their own.
Given the rising number of cases and Indian lockdown until May 3, officials say the government is likely to extend the lockdown at least by a week.
Meanwhile, calls have also grown for expanding polymerase chain reaction tests and expedite contact tracing.

Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreak
UPDATED as of April 26, 2020
What is Covid-19? Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
How contagious is Covid-19? Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.
Where did the virus come from? The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.
What is the current status of Covid-19?
The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a pandemic and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. As of Friday, Covid-19 had spread to 210 countries and infected more than 2,876,701 people with 201,534 deaths. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 24,342 with 779 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 12,227 confirmed cases with 256 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 52 cases, in which 16 patients recovered .
How dangerous is the disease?
The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those whove recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk.
How do I keep myself safe? The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.
Is it time to panic?
No. Th e government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. T here is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above. Related News ",TRUE,FAKE

""Of the four students who returned from China, one of them has been tested positive. We have taken all precautionary measures and there was no need to panic,"" Shailaja had said earlier.
Priya Abraham, director of ICMR-NIV in Pune, said 49 samples have been tested till now at the national institute of virology and one sample has tested positive.
""The positive sample belongs to a student from Kerala who was studying in Wuhan. Now a next test known as 'next-gen sequencing test' will be done on her sample and the final result will be declared till evening,"" Abraham said.
Explained: How China is building hospital for coronavirus patients so quickly?
The virus strain not seen before has spread to at least 17 countries, where authorities have been scrambling to contain the epidemic and evacuate their citizens from the worst-hit Hubei Province in China.
India, which is placed by a study at the 23rd place among ""high-risk"" countries where the virus can spread, has requested China to operate two flights to bring back its nationals from Hubei Province.
Authorities have been screening patients at airports, ports and borders for possible coronavirus infection and the Health Ministry has urged people to report themselves if they show symptoms of coronavirus such as cold and respiratory distress on the 24x7 helpline (011-23978046).
The ministry has asked people to refrain from travelling to China and the states bordering Nepal - Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim - have stepped up vigil.
""Per day a total of 9-10 samples are received at the facility (NIV-Pune) for testing. All facilities and capacity is available for testing of samples and it takes a day to test a sample for coronavirus (nCoV),"" Abraham said. Hundreds of people have been quarantined in hospitals, including over 800 in Kerala, and are being monitored by doctors, according to ministry officials.
On Wednesday, the only two Indian carriers that fly to China - IndiGo and Air India - announced the suspension of most of their flights to the country, joining other airlines based in Asia, North America and Europe which have restricted operations to the region.
Coronavirus confirmed in India: Student who returned from virus-hit Wuhan tests positive in Kerala
India has increased the number of airports from seven to 21 where thermal screening of passengers is being done for possible exposure to nCoV. These include airports at Gaya, Guwahati, Visakhapatnam, Varanasi, Goa, Bhubaneswar and Lucknow.
Apart from NIV-Pune, the health ministry has established four more laboratories to test samples at Alleppey, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai.
The health ministry has advised those who have recently travelled to China (within last 14 days) or had possible contact with a nCoV-infected person, to stay at home, in isolation for 14 days after returning and sleep in a separate room.
It has advised them to cover nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms (maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from any individual).

491,491,"The 2019-nCoV epidemic, known to the public as the novel coronavirus, represents an ever-changing and significant risk to the human population. A virus that had never been identified before began to infect humans in early to mid-December, leading to an explosion of cases primarily in areas of mainland China. This is a public-health concern because of the potential for the virus to spread globally and infect millions of people.
At this time, there is very little risk of infection in areas outside of mainland China. However, the virus has spread relatively quickly in China. This development should serve as a warning to other countries about the potential for this virus to cause large numbers of cases if not contained efficiently. While the scale of the current epidemic is large, the number of cases pales when compared with other respiratory viruses such as influenza, which has been estimated to have caused over 15,000,000 cases and 8,000 deaths in the U.S. alone this winter.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict how an epidemic caused by a new virus will turn out, but public-health officials have a clear goal of containing the outbreak so as to both reduce human disease and prevent the virus from becoming more adept at infecting humans.
They can do so by identifying infected people, limiting their contact with uninfected individuals, finding anyone who may have had contact with the infected person, and then monitoring those individuals for signs of disease. In this way, transmission from person to person can be reduced, thereby stopping the epidemic. This effort has been a challenge in mainland China, as the virus appears to be able to spread from human to human with an unexpectedly high efficiency, which results in tens of thousands of people needing to be investigated for potential infectionsan inordinately large burden for the public-health services to tackle.
While the situation changes almost daily, the virus appears to be causing both mild, flu-like disease and more-serious respiratory infections that require hospitalization. Clinical, research, and public-health efforts are ongoing to contain the virus and provide better options for detecting and treating infections. The speed with which information on case numbers is being conveyed and the distribution of virus and virus sequences is unprecedented.
Newsletter Sign-up Vaccines and diagnostic tests specific to this virus have already been constructed, and the virus is being tested against panels of U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved drugs to identify potential treatments. The ability to sequence the genes of the virus has allowed epidemiologists to piece together how the virus entered the human population and how it is spreading.
Combined with travel restrictions, these efforts will improve the ability of other countries to deal with the eventual appearance of infected individuals and allow them to more efficiently intervene to limit virus spread.
For the time being, most countries are planning, garnering resources, and monitoring the epidemic. For people outside of mainland China who want to do something, get your flu shot and donate bloodboth will help with immediate, pressing medical conditions while we wait to see how the 2019-nCoV epidemic will unfold.

Ghebreyesus also admitted that much remains unknown about the new coronavirus, including the source, how easily it spreads, its clinical features and its severity.
Present knowledge, according to him, is that the virus can cause severe disease and can even kill, but only causes milder symptoms for most people.

The Taiwan-based company, which operates numerous factories in mainland China, announced in a statement that it is monitoring the situation but does not expect any effects on its ""manufacturing commitments"". Foxconn is monitoring the situation closely. Given the current public health challenges associated with the coronavirus, we are applying all of the recommended health and hygiene measures to all aspects of our business in the affected markets.

It refers to the Chinese government's New Year holiday extension, a measure to try to curb the spread of the virus by encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid travel. ""We can continue to meet all global manufacturing commitments."" ""For political and commercial sensitivity reasons, we do not comment on our specific production processes,"" the company adds, ""but we can confirm that we have taken action to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations.

Due to China's massive role in global manufacturing and the large number of technology companies that rely on their factories to assemble products, the virus has also affected numerous hardware companies in Silicon Valley and beyond. Facebook, LG, and Razer have all started restricting employee travel to China, and some companies have advised employees who have recently traveled to China to work from home. The Danish game accessories manufacturer SteelSeries explains The Verge that it ""limited the travel of employees to China indefinitely"". Apple, which relies heavily on Foxconn for iPhone production, is concerned that the corona virus could disrupt its manufacturing times for upcoming smartphones and other products. Almost every new iPhone is assembled in factories operated by Foxconn's subsidiary Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. in Zhengzhou and by Taiwanese manufacturer Pegatron, which operates factories near Shanghai, according to Bloomberg . Although both manufacturers are several hundred kilometers from Wuhan, the outbreak still poses a risk, say analysts interviewed by Bloomberg . Any minor disruption to Apple's expansive and extremely complex supply chain in mainland China could lead to production delays, the report said. Apple has not yet made a public comment on the corona virus or the potential impact on its operations in China, where Apple employs more than 10,000 people in retail and corporate offices. Apple employees are also frequent flyers to China. Apple is United Airlines' largest corporate customer, which is partly due to the fact that Apple pre-orders 50 Business Class seats on the daily flight from United to Shanghai in San Francisco.

This was a bit jarring, not only because of the all-caps but because I was unaware that this was actually a thing. Are people really not going to Chinese restaurants because of the virus outbreak a half-a-world away? I haven't heard anyone raise a concern about this before. There has been no mention of anti-Asian sentiment over the virus on cable news or in any written reports about the virus that I've seen.
It never even occurred to me that locally-owned Asian businesses would be risky. I still don't believe they are, but after reading the warning I can't help but have that seed of doubt in my mind now. If anything, I think this strongly-worded warning could actually make people more likely to avoid these places, thinking to themselves, ""Hey, maybe I shouldn't go to Asian businesses now.""
There's no arguing that the intent of this warning was good, but sometimes making a big deal out of something that most people aren't really concerned about only makes them fear it more.

Several patients were admitted at the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Medical Center (V. Luna General Hospital) in Quezon City for possible case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), a military health official revealed on Sunday.
Captain Sherwin Joseph Sarmiento, spokesperson of the Health Service Command of the AFP-Public Affairs Office (PAO), confirmed that they were keeping an eye on an undisclosed number of persons under monitoring (PUM) and persons under investigation (PUI) isolated at the infection ward of the military healthcare facility.
Sarmiento refused to divulge the exact number of PUMs and PUIs being assessed citing the principle of confidentiality and data privacy.
PUMs are the ones with travel history in countries that the Department of Health says: China, Hong Kong and Macau (The PUMs are those with travel history to China, Hong Kong and Macau as advised by the Department of Health [DOH]), Sarmiento said in a radio interview over dzBB, referring to countries where the government implemented a travel ban.
PUI patients are patients with a history of travel at the same time, with symptoms such as cough, cold, fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath (The PUIs, on the other hand, are patients who have a travel history there and at the same time, were exhibiting symptoms like cough, colds, fever, throat irritation and difficulty in breathing), he added.
The V. Luna General Hospital is tasked to provide medical care to military and civilian personnel of the AFP, including their immediate dependents, when the nCov outbreak happened in Wuhan, China.
In the Philippines, the first confirmed nCoV case was noted on January 30, 2020  a 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan. As of Saturday, the Department of Health said there were three confirmed nCoV cases in the country including one fatality, the male companion of the woman.
Kapag po kasi exposure ang pinag-uusapan, ultimo mga kasama sa bahay. Pati po mga kamag-anak na nagkaroon ng exposure doon sa mismong military ay kina-quarantine o kaya ay ina-assess natin (When we talk about exposure, included here are the persons you live with. Even the relatives who were exposed to the military are being quarantined or assessed), Sarmiento said.
Sarmiento, who is a doctor, allayed fears by other patients admitted at V. Luna Hospital since the PUMs and PUIs were quarantined in a building separate from the main hospital.
The infection ward was previously being used to treat soldiers and their dependents with tuberculosis, measles and other multi-drug resistant diseases.
However, it has since been cleared and transformed to a quarantine area for military personnel and their dependents who are suspected to have acquired the deadly respiratory disease.

505,505,"IBM Business Partner Evanston Technology Partners and Cylera , recently partnered together to address new challenges facing hospitals, providing asset management and cybersecurity protection, through a newly formed joint Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) solution that provides healthcare delivery organizations a way to continuously manage, optimize, and secure critical medical devices, including ventilators and supporting healthcare assets such as IoT, operational technology (OT) and network connected devices. ""Hospitals and healthcare providers are rapidly adding new medical devices, ventilators, and the like, to their network at a frenetic pace, equipment at risk for cybersecurity compromise,"" said Emmanuel Jackson, Founder & CEO, Evanston Technology Partners (ETP), a certified, Minority Business Enterprise.
Healthcare delivery organizations globally have been challenged historically with the ever-increasing demand of connected medical devices that are in need of continuous management; add a global pandemic into the mix and the risk is exacerbated exponentially. As Ralph Ramsey, Global Associate Partner at IBM Security Services for Healthcare and Life Sciences, states ""the combination of cyber threats and lack of situational awareness has created the perfect storm atop of what will inevitably be a huge lesson learned for many healthcare organizations. Not only in managing the next crisis, but the role of enabling technologies that will be relied on in a variety of public health emergencies.""
A consequence of meeting the COVID-19 pandemic at such a rapid pace is that government officials and healthcare organizations are unable to balance demand, cybersecurity and the inventory management of all the new devices being added daily. ""This absolutely has an effect on saving lives given the shortage of life-saving equipment that must be deployed to the next hot-spot,"" Ramsey added.
""During a crisis, the private sector, cities, and states need to work together to get devices and resources to the areas of most need. It is critical to have a comprehensive management solution of network-connected devices that will assist healthcare organizations in tracking inventory, as well as allowing organizations to assess their device capabilities and security posture,"" said Tremayne Smith, Chief Information Security Officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. ""Being able to secure and easily share information from these systems, as we have learned to do with electronic health records, will allow us to support our communities and save lives, which should be the ultimate goal during an emergency response.""
These risks and consequences propelled leading hospital systems to approach Evanston Technology Partners to develop what today is being announced today as the Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) Solution.
ETP's Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC), powered by IBM and Cylera, will provide a comprehensive overview of the availability and security of network-connected healthcare assets and medical equipment, following the guidelines of the CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities. The HAOC will help healthcare providers effectively manage and maintain these critical medical devices and resources to prepare and respond to medical surge events, such as the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic.
""Healthcare organizations are challenged with enormous visibility and security gaps during the COVID-19 response given increased patient care needs, medical device requirements and the growth of targeted threat actors looking to take advantage of the current situation. Hospitals not only need actionable operational intelligence, but they also want the means to efficiently monitor their environment to the minute and dynamically respond to any changes,"" said Timur Ozekcin, Co-founder and CEO at Cylera. ""A unified solution provides the best of multiple approaches to solve a broad range of operational and cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.""
The HAOC solution is designed to safely and remotely provide hospitals real-time operational intelligence, inventory monitoring, and cybersecurity of critical medical devices and equipment which are of vital need during a public health emergency. These medical devices include ventilators, infusion pumps, imaging devices and laboratory equipment. The HAOC enables bidirectional situational awareness between public health agencies and healthcare providers to help identify and eliminate inefficiencies around unused or underutilized assets. Thus, allowing comprehensive management across distributed locations to securely facilitate effective preparedness and response while minimizing roadblocks to patient treatment.
The HAOC solution is available now.

The Corona Virus phishing scheme is worth mentioning not just because a lot of users can be targets of it, due to the notoriety of the virus, but also because the risks involve some pretty high-profile payloads in addition to the stolen credentials. How the Main Corona Virus Phishing Schemes Work
Especially after the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Corona Virus an international emergency in a statement released at the end of January, phishing campaigns using it have begun to spring up. #1. Fake CDC Alerts
In one such phishing campaign, first spotted by KnowBe4 and further reported by Bleeping Computer , the attackers bait the victims with a list of active infections in their surroundings. In order to access the list and see if there are any outbreaks of the virus in your vicinity, you need to click a link that redirects you to a credential-stealing page.
This Corona Virus phishing email imitates the ones sent by the CDC Health Alert Network. The logo and everything else inside looks consistent with the authority allegedly sending out this warning. The targets are invited to join the coordinated effort to keep the virus at bay.
The malicious link first seems to go to the official CDC portal but then gets rerouted towards a malicious domain used for credential phishing. That means that victims are prompted to enter their Outlook login details, which then get stolen and used for malicious purposes .

Its remarkable that this phishing email seems very well put together, imitating the style and feel of the official CDC alerts. #2. Advice Emails from Fake Wuhan Medical Authorities
Another popular Corona Virus phishing campaign which also targets US and UK users is impersonating Wuhan medical specialists and claims to distribute advice for dealing with the virus. Besides listing a few common symptoms of the disease, the emails offer up an attachment with allegedly important medical advice.
Initially spotted by Mimecast, the Corona Virus phishing campaign tries to take advantage of the panic wave created by the virus. The email recipients are prompted to download the attachment with the note This little measure can save you.

If victims download the malicious PDF attachment, they also risk infecting their computer with a malware payload. #3. Emotet payloads
Other Corona Virus phishing campaigns seem to have been launched by Emotet , especially in the Japan area. The mechanism of that campaign is similar: victims are tricked into clicking a malicious link in order to find out more about mandatory regulations for protection against the Corona Virus, but instead, they get delivered the Emotet payload as soon as they click the link. The banking Trojan is notoriously stealthy and difficult to remove once it enters your system.
Emotet is surely just one of the more notorious malware strains to jump on the Corona Virus phishing bandwagon. Other malware and ransomware gangs will probably try to use genuine public fear regarding this outbreak to their advantage. Stay vigilant and dont believe every email you receive, no matter how legit it looks. How to Stay Safe from the Corona Virus Phishing Schemes
It doesnt take a lot to stay safe from phishing schemes in general, but this one may be a little trickier.
Good cybersecurity habits help too, of course, so make sure you: Always inspect a link (by hovering with the mouse button over it) to see where it really leads to, especially if you received it from an out-of-the-ordinary email message or direct message; Never enter your account credentials when you are redirected to a page for downloading a file or whatever pretext the email message used; Remember that even email addresses which come from seemly legit-looking domains may not be what they seem  its still very easy for hackers to spoof their email address into something trustworthy; Be wary of any communication that tries to make you act on impulse, by rousing strong emotions of alert, fear of missing out (you won a prize but you need to claim it now, etc.), panic and so on.
In addition to this general advice, you need to protect yourself from the malicious payloads that some of the emails in the Corona Virus phishing campaign carry.
One must-do is to keep your software up to date and apply patches as soon as they are released. Unpatched software and apps can create security loopholes you can get infected through. There are automatic tools to help with this (such as our Thor Free ).
Another important defense is to have an extra security layer on top of your Antivirus . Contemporary threats are getting more and more sophisticated and simple reactive software cant stand up to it anymore. Thats why Antivirus is not enough .
To be properly protected even in the bad scenario where you click a malicious link that wants to deliver a payload in your system, you need a DNS traffic filter .
If you dont already use one, you can try out our Thor Premium Home (containing both an Antivirus and a DNS traffic filter and automatic software updater) for a month with this promo: The easy way to protect yourself against malware Here's 1 month of Thor Foresight Home, on the house! Use it to: Block malicious websites and servers from infecting your PC Auto-update your software and close security gaps Keep your financial and other confidential details safe EASY AND RELIABLE. WORKS WITH ANY ANTIVIRUS. Try Thor Foresight Final Thoughts
Remember: the era in which you could easily spot a phishing email just by its bad grammar and laughable pretentions is fading. Malware actors are working more and more as organizations of highly professional individuals.
You need to learn to pay attention to the finer details, such as inspecting links to see where they really lead to. Also watch out for any communications which try to convey a sense of urgency, encouraging you to act now (enter credentials or call, etc.).
Even if the claim is legitimate, theres no need to be impulsive. Check, double-check and think it through. That way malicious campaigns such as the Corona Virus phishing scheme will not fool you into any trouble. Stay safe! ",TRUE,TRUE

516,516,"The biggest threat to our collective humanity today is not the suspected threat of a Third World War, but a corrosive, debilitating, murderous pathogen known as new Corona Virus. The fear of a World War III was fuelled by tensions and differences among key super powers dictating contemporary geo-politics notably: the US, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, South Korea and the entire Middle East. But while relationships with the worlds power axis will always have implications for global peace, security and stability, the biggest and the most urgent threat by far is the outbreak of a new strain of the Corona Virus, in Wuhan, China which has within a short space of one month shown the vulnerability of man, the conflict between man and biology, and the limitations of science in the face of an immediate, accidental, unforeseeable, pathogenic onslaught.
The first case of Corona Virus was reported just before the Chinese Lunar New Year 2020 celebrations, and since then, the new virus has defied both man and science. On January 28, the highest number of reported cases was reported, but by Monday, February 10, that had jumped exponentially to 97 casualties per day and total cases in excess of 40, 000, with 908 persons reported dead. The statistics and the sero-prevalence rate seem unprecedented, far worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome of 2003 which claimed 774 lives. The World Health Organization has classified the new Corona Virus as a public health emergency of international concern, a delicate, diplomatic phrasing which barely stops short of declaring the nCoV-2019, as it is otherwise known, a global pandemic  considering the fact that mainland China, especially Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the Hubei province in general, remain the epicenter  99% of reported cases are in mainland China and out of the total number of deaths, only two have occurred outside China.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended China for its efforts at prevention and containment, even if the Politburo, the highest political body in China has had to express regrets for failing the people. The truth is: China is overwhelmed. Businesses have been affected, the stock market is down, lives are threatened, over 40 million people are in quarantine. China is engaging the world as the epicenter of a crisis, the global economy is likely to be affected given Chinas strategic importance, and yet nobody knows when the Corona virus will ease off, or when scientists will find a cure. It is not only China that is at risk, it is the entire world. Our civilization is under threat and of course, the tragedy is man-made. These are the cold, uncomfortable facts as at the time of this writing. The Corona Virus has brought the entire world to the precipice of uncertainty and disaster. It reminds us collectively of our mortality and the common humanity and vulnerability that we share.
Globalization turned the world into a small village, technology erased distances, but in the face of a global scourge like new Corona Virus, the world has turned into a much smaller village. Most of the people and countries that are taking precautions against Corona Virus dont even know where Wuhan is on the map. Some people ate snake meat or is it Pangolin or bat meat in Wuhan and they got infected with a virus  animal to man transmission, which has now spread to over 27 countries and mutated as a deadly human-to-human communicable disease. China which is ordinarily regarded as a major superpower has suddenly become a pariah nation. Countries have issued travel alerts to their citizens: do not go to China, and those who are in China are being evacuated and whoever arrives from China is immediately quarantined for two weeks.
This is the same China that only recently engaged the United States in a trade war. The same China is now the diseased nation that nobody wants to touch. Imports from China have been suspended. Trips to China have been put on hold. Chinas tourism industry is bound to suffer. Who wants to go to a country where a virus is on rampage, and the air is polluted? It is not for nothing that the media in Europe has dubbed the Corona Virus, the China Virus  an average Chinese citizen would not like that  but the truth is that the new Corona Virus wears the toga of a nationality. Before it, there was the Swine flu (2009), Polio (2014), Zika (2016), Ebola (2014, 2019) but it is the new Corona Virus that has obtained a national passport and an identification tag of notorious universal recognition. This may have translated into racist conclusions about Chinese identity and cuisine. I have heard allegations that the Chinese eat anything and everything, including animals that are considered a taboo in many cultures  Bats? Cockroaches? Rats? Snakes? Millipedes and centipedes? Monkeys? Pangolin? E-eeish! It is said that the Chinese have brought this latest biological dissonance upon humanity because of their unusual culinary taste. I know people who have simply opted to stay away from anything Chinese in the meantime, until there is some certainty about what exactly is going on. I wanted to order food from a Chinese Restaurant the other day. I was quietly reminded of Corona Virus. I had no option but to restrain my palate. I wanted Chinese balm, a popular product in Nigeria, a few days later. I was also advised to be careful. I ignored that advice. The labelling of everything Chinese as an item crowned by a virus is exaggerated and overblown. But as Nigerians would say in pidgin English: who wan die?
This is probably why every country and institution is taking precautions. The United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand have had cause to evacuate their citizens from China. Airlines including FinnAir, American Airlines, United, Cathay Pacific, Air India, Ethiopian Airlines, British Airways, Air Asia, and Lufthansa have either stopped flights to China or reduced their Chinese operations by 90%. The effect is that supply chains have been disrupted with consequences for trade performance. The global economy is bound to slow down in the long run if this situation persists. But what is perhaps more relevant to us should be this: How prepared is Africa and particularly Nigeria? I dont think Africa is prepared at all, and we are likely to be worst hit should the virus make an effective landing in our continent.
For now across Africa, we have only heard of suspected cases: in Ghana where there were two suspected cases involving a Chinese and an Argentine who returned from China, but the result was negative in both cases. Suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Botswana have also proven negative. The only reported case of infection involving an African is that of a Cameroonian student living in Wuhan. Kenya has taken steps to evacuate its students in China. Mozambique has suspended its visa on arrival policy. Africa and South America seem insulated from the scourge so far. But for how much longer? The Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday was extended, in the face of the outbreak of the virus, but that holiday ended yesterday, Monday, February 10. Using that as guide, if there was any Chinese living in Africa or doing business in Africa, he or she is likely to return to base after the holiday. In the last decade or more, Sino-African relationship has grown tremendously, China seeking to fill a vacuum inadvertently created by the EU and the United States, has increased its scope of influence in Africa through friendly loans, investments and cultural outreach. It is not an accident that African leaders at the just concluded 33rd AU Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa expressed solidarity with China! The Chinese presence in Africa is unmistakable and it is quite pronounced in a country like Nigeria where the Chinese are involved in significant sectors of the economy including oil and gas, telecommunications, manufacturing, infrastructure, SMEs and retail trade. This week, all the Chinese who went home on holiday will start returning one after the other.
When the story of the Corona Virus broke, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was most unusually proactive, which I think is commendable. The Federal Ministry of Health quickly followed suit, to educate Nigerians about the threat of the Corona Virus. Preventive guidelines were announced, and a travel advisory was issued. This is indeed commendable, even if the efforts were not translated into local, indigenous languages, that is  the languages of the majority of Nigerians. The campaign has thus far been so elitist and restricted. In due course, the Nigerian authorities further announced that the Federal Government had established eight isolation centres as follows: in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and seven states of the Federation  Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Enugu, Delta, Cross River and Kano. The problem is that nobody knows exactly where these isolation centres are located.
The relevant authorities tell us that in preparing for the Corona Virus which has not yet been reported in Nigeria, they are relying on the protocols and infrastructure already put in place in 2014 to combat the Ebola Virus. In 2014, Nigeria was confronted with the Ebola Virus crisis, introduced to the country by a traveler from Liberia who came to Nigeria to seek spiritual cure for Ebola. Knowledge and experience can definitely prove useful in everything including a biological and pharmaceutical crisis such as Corona Virus. But has Nigeria done enough or is Nigeria prepared? I dont think so. There is definitely no evidence that we have enough medical counter-measures to protect the medical and public health personnel who are supposed to man our ports. A gentleman who just returned from Chicago reported on live television and I have no cause to doubt him, that the situation at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport in Lagos, to cite a specific example, is chaotic and below standard practice. Government officials pretend to check for high temperature and other symptoms but they are not protected. Nigeria has not made any provision for medical counter measures. Nigeria is sending medical personnel and Ministry officials to the ports to put them at risk. Until we have another case of Stella Adadevoh, like Li Weliang, the Chinese whistleblower who paid the supreme price for Corona Virus, the Nigerian government is not likely to wake up. That is unacceptable.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health and state governments have to do a lot more. I will comment on the latter. As at this moment, only three states  Lagos, Ebonyi and Ogun out of the 36 states of the Federation would seem to have shown interest in the Corona Virus prevention campaign. We expect every state of the Federation, close as they are to the grassroots, to take up the campaign and inform the populace appropriately. At the national level, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health will also need to address what has become around the subject of Corona Virus, an infodemic crisis  that is the crisis of conspiracy theories and misinformation and hazardous false information. Is the Corona Virus a biological weapon?. Really? Is it a strategy by big pharmaceutical companies to enlarge market and increase profit? President Donald Trump and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have also been linked to the conspiracy. Does that make sense? We have also been told that eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction can help prevent a Corona Virus infection. Is that true? The Nigerian agencies are yet to respond to this. They should. They should take the additional step of addressing the spiritual question which determines everything in Nigeria from politics to business. Is Corona Virus a spiritual affliction or biology gone awry? If care is not taken, Nigerian shamanists, prophets, traditionalists and pastors will soon take advantage of the uncertainty to claim that they had predicted the occurrence of the virus and that, indeed they have the solution. Government should immediately arrest anyone who mouths such idiocy. Our only hope is that the Corona Virus will never make its way here, but as the Boys Scouts motto states, we should Be Prepared. The bad news is that there is no effective treatment for the virus. And a worse virus may soon show up, leaving humanity effectively at the mercy of disease and the environment.
II: Asisat Oshoala, the Super Star When Asisat Oshoala, the Super Falcons and Barcelona Ferminino striker was declared winner of the African Womens Footballer of the Year, 2019, a few weeks ago, the big concern was that her own compatriots who sat on the Confederation of Africa Football judges panel refused to vote for her. Every single one of them voted for an outsider. They didnt consider their own compatriot good enough. I have addressed this matter at length in a piece titled The Betrayal of Asisat Oshoala, (This Day, back page, January 14).
At the time, Ms. Oshoala lost her cool momentarily and tried to engage her critics which was absolutely unnecessary. But the best response that she has offered, and the one that is relevant, is how, after returning to her club in Europe, she has been putting up such sterling performance that further confirms her status as a super star on the pitch.
In January, she won the Africa Football Womens Player of the year to equal the record of fellow Nigerian Perpetua Nkwocha. With her current performance, Oshoala does not want to just equal existing record, she wants to break the record in African Womens Football. After winning the CAF award in January she reportedly said: I want to create my own history and not just equal someone elses record  Im going to give my best to create mine. She is doing just that right now. Five-time winner of the Womens Africa Cup of Nations, best player at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Womens World Cup, winner of the BBC Footballer of the Year, 2015, Chinese Womens Super League Top Scorer, 2017, she scored a brace in Barcelonas 101 trouncing and humiliation of Real Sociedad in the Spanish Womens League Super Cup Final on February 9, 2020. Loaned to Barcelona from China in January 2019, and later offered a permanent transfer, Asisat Oshoala has been a formidable and result-oriented member of the Barca line up and one of its most valuable players.
On January 11, 2020, four days after the CAF awards, Oshoala scored four goals in a 6-0 win against CD Tacon. She has been consistent since then. Whoever has any doubt about her achievements and quality may end up voting for her someday soon. Congratulations Asisat. Keep shooting. Keep shining.

523,523,"The Department of Health (DOH) advised health workers to observe precautionary measures amid the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
Dr. Rolando Enrique Domingo (R), Undersecretary of the Department of Health (DOH)

Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said that all health workers should wear protective personnel equipment (PPEs) when dealing with patients.
I strongly advise you to wear protective personnel equipment such as disposable face mask, gown, and gloves when in contact with a patients blood, body fluids or secretions, in keeping with the prevailing hospital protocols, said Domingo.
I urge you to wash your laundry thoroughly, boost your immunity by taking vitamins, and monitor yourselves for any signs and symptoms. Your health and safety is of paramount concern to the Department, he added.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured that the PPEs will be provided to all health workers.
Thats one of the first orders of the day when we heightened our infection control, our case management capacities in the hospitals, he said.
They are the first ones to be provided with PPEsthat means the googles, headgear, masks, gloves, gowns or aprons, including the shoe guard they would have to be the first [to have these] because they need to be protected while taking care of those [patients], he added.
Meanwhile, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) also issued guidelines for private sector workplaces in response to the 2019 nCoV ARD.
The DOLE said that all employers must provide information to their workers about the new virus including how it is being transmitted, disease outcome as well as treatment options for their workers.
They must ensure that their workplaces must be cleaned with disinfectant and that water, soap, and sanitizer must always be available in all their washrooms and toilets.
Employers should avoid or reduce direct exposure of their workers to animals, environments, and objects which may be possibly carrying the 2019-nCoV [ARD].
Workers should be reminded to stay healthy and keep their workplaces clean.
The DOLE also advised employers to monitor the health of workers particularly those with fever and other flu symptoms and those who have traveled to or worked in countries affected with the 2019 nCoV [ARD].
Meanwhile, if a worker is suspected to have been afflicted with the new virus, the employer should provide him or her with a face mask to prevent risk of spreading the infection. The worker should immediately be isolated in a separate well-ventilated room.
Refer the worker to the company healthcare provider or to the nearest local health center or hospital for laboratory confirmation if the history, signs and symptoms are consistent with a suspected case of 2019-nCoV ARD, the DOLE said.
The employer should report it to the Department of Health and ensure the implementation of recommendations provided by the DOH on the management and transport of suspected case.

526,526,"Homeopathy Treatment of Corona Virus Last Updated On: February 3, 2020
With the advent of the third case of coronavirus reported in India, its a cause of grave concern for us and hence today we are going to shed further light on to how to combat this outbreak.
All the cases were reported in Kerala itself, where the first patient was a former student from Wuhan University in China ( the city where the virus originated).
Followed this, Indian Government is preparing to evacuate its citizens from Chinas Wuhan city via airlift. The USA has also given protocol to its citizens not to travel to China, till further notice. Similarly Indian citizens are also urged to refrain from travelling there.
The Ministry of AYUSH on Wednesday issued an advisory for the prevention of infection from this novel strain of coronavirus using homoeopathy. The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy(CCRH), in the 64th meeting of its Scientific advisory board on 28thJanuary,2020, discussed the ways and means of prevention of Coronavirus infection through Homoeopathy. It also gives some dietary recommendations of easily digestible, light and soft diets, apart from personal hygiene tips to prevent this air-borne infection.
Before this new strain came into being, there were six other coronavirus strains  including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This newly discovered strain is designated as 2019-nCoV and commonly called the novel strain. Among humans, three other strains of coronavirus continuously circulate and cause pneumonia, bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, and even the common cold.
It is believed to have originated last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife meat. Health experts suspect it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species. Coronaviruses thrive more in the winter and are airborne. The typical incubation period for a cold-causing coronavirus strain is three days, however, for the novel strain, this period is anywhere between two to 10 days.
Till now it has killed 362 people and infected more than 17000. Fewer than 100 cases have been recorded outside China by spreading to 23 other countries, including Indias neighbours Nepal and Sri Lanka, and Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and US etc. The first death outside of Chinawas recorded in Philippines today. The Cabinet Secretary of GOI has reviewed the preventive measures on the coronavirus outbreak with secretaries in the ministries of health, external affairs, civil aviation etc. Approximately 35,000 people have undergone thermal screening in the country and a list has been served to the health ministries of various states of the people who recently travelled to China.
According to the AYUSH ministry advisory, following are some tips for prevention: Maintain personal hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid spitting in public. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your face during cough or sneeze and wash your hands after coughing or sneezing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Preferably, use an N95 mask while travelling or working in public places to avoid droplet transmission If you suspect Corona Viral infection, wear a mask and contact your nearest hospital immediately.
Alarming signs of infection include fever, generalised weakness ( fatigue), cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.In more severe cases, it can lead to leukopenia, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Homeopathic medicine can serve beautifully as preventive medicine against the infection.
It should also be taken into account that homoeopathy works based on the symptoms present in patients. Also according to the geographical conditions and climate the symptoms of a coronavirus patient may slightly differ in India compared to that of China.
Homeopathic therapeutics are based on symptom similarity and so there are over 100plus medicines that , if selected carefully , have the capability to treat viral diseases. Some homeopathic remedies have the ability to prevent viruses from attacking.
Since virus attacks on our immune system making it weaker day by day, homoeopathy works to improve it along with acting as a preventive to control and stop the spread of the Epidemic. Prescriptions in such cases can be chosen by your physician either as a constitutional prescription or in the form of a similar nosode, further profiling the concept of Genus epidemicus ( a specific remedy chosen for an epidemic on a common symptom picture).

A new law could give you up to three shots at getting just the right picture. It's called AB 2405. It was proposed last week by state Assemblyman Phillip Chen from Diamond Bar. He said it was partly inspired by his work last year where he asked Californians about how to improve the DMV experience. Under his idea, for each extra picture you want, you'll be asked for a five-dollar voluntary donation that goes to driver education programs. Then you can pick the best one out of those three. It would be the second ""shot"" for this kind of law  a similar one was proposed in 2018 before it stalled out. But right now, if you wanted to get a new picture for your license, you'd have to pay upwards of $32 to get a duplicate ID.

No, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ), is not related to the popular refreshing Mexican beer brand called Corona. But thats not stopping people from searching Google to apparently try to double check.
Google Trends released data showing that around late January, there was a marked spike in searches for the terms beer virus and corona beer virus.
Jan. 25 showed the height of the spike in searches for the term beer virus, as searches rose to a value of 100 on Google Trends indicating a peak in popularity. For the term corona beer virus, it peaked at a value of 81, so searches for that term hit the top of the spike on Jan. 25, but the term was searched a little less often.
Connecticut, Oregon and New York searched the term corona beer virus the most. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Nebraska and Kansas were in the top three for opting to keep it simple and search beer virus the most out of the two choices. Google Trends
Worldwide those search terms both hit their peak on Jan. 25 as well according to Google Trends. Searches for the term beer virus were highest in the countries of Serbia, Austria and Ireland, Google reported. Searches for the longer corona beer virus were highest in South Africa, Portugal and the Netherlands. Google Trends
The Miami Herald points out that it might be Google itself leading to the mix up. The search term corona beer virus has popped up as the second option in the search engines predictive search feature when corona was typed into the search field, pointing to a possible cause of confusion.

The banks open two or three days a week for counter-related or self-serving machine services. Schools and educational institutions remain closed. A majority are still in self quarantine as part of the precautionary measures against the spread of the virus. This quarantine would not have happened if the people practise good hygiene.

Spitting is one bad habit of the Chinese that annoys me the most, not just the disgusting mucus on the floor but also the loud irritating throat-clearing sound.

If you happen to be in Beijing, check out the streets, especially the entrance or exit of subway stations, and you will see patches of dark spots.

560,560,"I am sure you aware of the corona virus infection that is causing concern around the world. A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.
There is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.
The symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flufever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.
Corona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infectionssevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.
So, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infectioncorona virus included. I would check that off the list.
First, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.
Most people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.
If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.
For vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)
Also, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.
Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.
As I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Cant Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.
The RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.
To prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.
Finally, it is important to maintain optimal hydrationdrink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.
Conventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your handsI agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.
As for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It wont help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)
My last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide. To find a holistic doctor near you go to: www.icimed.com.

570,570,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which prompted the World Health Organisation (WHO) to sound a global health emergency in January, has affected over 34,000 people worldwide and cut short the lives of over 720 so far.
The respiratory infection, which is now more widespread than the 2002-03 severe respiratory acute syndrome (SARS) in terms of number of people affected, originated in China. The first known human infection, likely originated from a single infected animal, in early December 2019. It was detected in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province, in mid-December 2019. The 2019-nCoV subsequently engulfed the whole of China and in no time spread its tentacles to other countries across the world.
While the outbreak is spreading all over rapidly, Chinese health authorities are working on determining the origin of the virus. They claim that the virus could have spread from a seafood market in Wuhan, though without any conclusive evidence. The WHO also says an animal source appears most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak.
How Deadly Is It? According to some experts, the novel coronavirus outbreak may not be as deadly when compared with earlier coronavirus outbreaks like SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS killed close to 800 people  300 in China alone  MERS, which did not spread widely, killed about one-third of those who got affected (858 deaths of 2,494 people affected).
The number of people tested positive for the 2019 n-CoV, around the world and the number of deaths related to it so far suggest a fatality rate of 2%, which is considered to be on the higher side for a respiratory virus. However, the number of infected individuals, who may not have been diagnosed, is likely to be much higher, suggesting that the fatality rate could be well below 2%.
In layman terms, viruses cannot be deadly and can go undetected. A deadly virus typically has a more complex and severe list of symptoms, including a sudden onset and a higher chance of death. This causes patients to report to hospitals at earlier stages of the infection, creating a panic situation in medical facilities due to the high number of infected individuals with severe symptoms in very little time. According to several experts, though infections like these are difficult to detect and control, they are fortunately less lethal.
Containing Spread Will measures like airport screenings and isolation of infected individuals contain the epidemic of n-CoV? At this early stage, there seems to be no definite answer. With few historical references to look back on, clarity is far from certain. Results could in about a months time establish and only then will it be clear if the measures being taken by most cities were any worth.
As of now, it appears that the infected individuals can transmit the virus even before having the symptoms of it. On one hand, quarantining infected individuals and keeping them in isolation slows down the epidemic, while on the other, there is a huge risk of those at a pre-symptomatic stage going undetected.
Chinas Mass Quarantine Removal of the suspected source from the disease-hit area is mandatory but not sufficient. Chinese officials did take the necessary steps and shut the Wuhan wet-market, from where the virus is said to have originated. The next step China had to take was to contain the epidemic. In order to do so, Wuhans public health authorities cordoned the ground zero, by shutting public transport and other services claiming to be in a state of war.
While isolation of individuals is a common practice during public health emergencies, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented. Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus.
Looking at it from the outside, one may welcome Chinas move of quarantining millions of people. But it is a mere delusion to assume that one persons risk of infection is the same as anothers because they live in the same region. To isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease is more about allaying fear among public, though in reality, the severity of the disease is a lot milder.
Assuming that less than 1% of Wuhans 11 million population is infected with the virus, we could say that 99% of the people are not positive cases of the virus. With the right public healthcare response, the majority of the people who are affected by n-CoV would be highly unlikely to contract the disease.
Such mass quarantines have not only led to crowded hospitals and panic but are also resulting in shortage of food and supplies, dip in local economies and among all major risks, creating scope for new health problems for those who are not affected.
Death of a Whistle-blower Is he dead? Is he not? Li Wenliang, the doctor who warned the medical community about severe pneumonia cases in December and was reprimanded by Wuhan authorities for that warning, has reportedly died of the coronavirus. His death was initially reported by Chinas state-run paper, Global Times, then retracted, leading to mass confusion.
After the news of Lis death initially broke on Wednesday in Beijing, the public  that considered him a whistle-blower and a hero  mourned his death and directed their ire at Chinese authorities. Adding to the confusion, several Chinese media outlets reported that Li was, in fact, still alive. Chinas National Supervisory Commission, the countrys top anti-corruption agency, announced in a statement that it would send a team to Wuhan to investigate his death.
However, the hospital in which he worked and was admitted, in an official statement, said: Our hospitals ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected with coronavirus during his work in the fight against the coronavirus epidemic. He died at 2:58 am on Feb 7 after attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful.
Is it lab-grown? Suspicions are being raised globally over the origins of the n-CoV. Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese bio warfare, alleged that the advanced virus research laboratory, known as the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is behind the accidental leak of the lethal virus. The institute, linked to Beijings covert biological weapons programme, is the only declared site in China capable of working with deadly viruses.
A scientific paper by a group of Chinese researchers, published in the medical journal The Lancet argued that the first 13 of 41 patients affected by the virus had no contacts with the seafood market at all in early December. Another conspiracy theory doing the rounds is whether the Chinese Communist Party leaked the virus on purpose as a desperate attempt to stay in power.
Meanwhile, China has slammed Israels recent claim that the lethal new nCoV originated from the leaked biological warfare lab. Chinese researchers are now busy concentrating their efforts in developing vaccines to contain the epidemic. While we may not know the truth about the origins of the 2019-nCoV, some forward thinking on the why and frequency of such virus attacks must be done on a war footing.
Certain laboratories in the institute (Wuhan Institute of Virology) have probably been engaged, in terms of research and development, in Chinese (biological weapons), at least collaterally, yet not as a principal facility of the Chinese BW alignment

573,573,"It is not politically correct to be a nationalist these days, but thats largely because of the self-serving myths that globalists like to engage in and a general lack of historical knowledge and rational thinking. The word nationalist brings to mind the Nazis, where we are regularly reminded that they were National Socialists, emphasizing the first word in the phrase, but never the second. Like I said, self-serving myths.
However, while the word socialist hasnt changed all that much since the 1930s, the word nationalist has. In other words, its a logical fallacy called equivocation, where the same word has two different meanings. Globalists (and the MSM, the general public, liberal progressives, etc) invoke the old meaning to criticize adherents of the new meaning.
There was indeed something nasty about the old nationalists, but people dont really like to acknowledge what it is. Was much of it racist? Yes, of course. But it was racist for a reason: they believed that SCIENCE had shown, in light of Darwinism, that the races were definitely different, and indeed some races were superior to others. And yet, it is still not fair to equate the old nationalism with racism, as, in point of fact, racism was infused into anti -nationalist, communist, and even progressive views, as well . Yet, people recoil in horror at the word nationalist but carry on their merry way when they hear the word progressive.
The reason why people dont like to admit the historical reality of the pervasiveness (beyond, except, when ascribed to nationalists) of scientific racism is because they still like to claim the mantle of SCIENCE, which at present still accepts Darwinism as true and valid. They want their Darwinism without the part where they behave as if it is actually true, which is pretty much all that separates them from the progressives of the 1920s to 1930s, where they were courageous enough to behave as though Darwinism was true.
I have a whole page on my eugenics website dedicated to progressives complaining that people would not submit to SCIENCE and instead resort to sentimentality.
The short story here on how Darwinism became attached to these political aspects is that the prevailing notion of the time that a nation was basically a repository for a particular subset of the human species, and that such subsets could themselves be seen as operating on Darwinian principles. Eg, the social organism. Thus, there was survival of the fittest not just between rival, individual organisms, but also between populations. We still have the concept today, actually. It is called intraspecific competition. (And thus, why it is the case that so long as Darwinism is believed to be true, there will be people who believe it ought to be extended to race, etc).
Germany believed it was the fittest and that it had the evolutionary right and obligation, as a people, to devour those who were not as fitand this would be good for the entire human race. This explains that little known fact that before the Nazis began wide scale extermination of the Jews, they first launched the T4 project, in which hundreds of thousands of GERMAN citizens who were disabled, mentally ill, etc, were exterminated. Such people dragged down the social organism (eg, useless eaters) and stood in the way of a fitbody. This was laid out in Binding and Hoches  Allowing the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life  which was published years before the Nazi party even existed. The nation was in essence an organism subject to Darwinian principles.
Germany was country to have a large concentration of people who believed such things. Turkey (when killing the Armenians) had a similar conception, as did Japan (the Rape of Nanking, killing of prisoners, etc). WW1 was, as you can imagine, a humiliation for Germany and Turkey, who believed they were biologically superior. Likewise Japan after WW2. But there were people who had this notion diffused throughout the world, including the United States: This is not theory, but fact, and displays its force as fact, whatever theories may be thrown across its track.Living political constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice . Society is a living organism and must obey the laws of life ,
Woodrow Wilson. American president.
Yipes!
It will be hard to find many more internationalist than Wilson without going full Bolshevik. So, like I said, this nasty business is not at all uniquely identifiable with early 20th century nationalism.
So, look. Even if it logically follows from Darwinism that nations should be seen as living organisms that must obey the laws of life, there are very few people who believe that, today. And certainly not most nationalists.
AND CERTAINLY NOT ME. (I, for one, think Darwinism is excrement.)
I lead with this, because the Globalists like to think that it is thanks to them and their institutions that the world has enjoyed relative peace after WW2. Ah, no.
First of all, this Darwinian-infused notion of nationalism that existed prior to WW2 disappeared for the same reason that eugenics itself fell by the wayside. Eugenicists were humiliated by the outcome of WW2, shocked that their ideas could lead to such horrors. They repackaged and pursued their views via  crypto-eugenics  afterwards. But there was not much room for a social body explanation anymore, as the countries which postured as Supremely Superior biologically speaking were destroyed by American mutts.
The Globalists like to invoke international organizations, especially the UN, but they are reluctant to mention NATO in the same analysis. NATO is an international organization, but it is an organization centered on exerting MILITARY POWER. And within NATO, the number one puncher is, hands down, without a doubt, the United States of America. To cut to the chase, the relative peace the world has enjoyed has been thanks to the USA and its doctrine of being ready to fightand wina global war fought on two fronts.
Without the US, most of the world would be speaking German, Japanese, and/or Russian right now. Thats a fact.
Globalists want to trumpet the success of their institutions while ignoring the protective shield that the United States has provided for them over the decades. They are like the secretary who works in the office of a NFL football team that wins the Super Bowl. Sure, the secretary gets the ring, just like the players, and indeed, the secretary has contributed to the overall success of the team, but no one would fail to understand that the ones who chiefly provided the victory were the ones on the field, slamming away at another team for four quarters.
In the same way, the UN has perhaps done some occasional good, but whatever good they accomplished they accomplished because the US (primarily) was standing behind them with a billy club.
But I would dispute even the idea that we can even say there has been relative peace after WW2. There hasnt been another World War but that does not seem like the only criterion that should be on the table. Lets be real: since WW2, hundreds of million were killed in various communist countries, there were civil wars, there were genocides in Rwanda (also infused with Darwinism) and Cambodia, etc., etc. Relative peace? I think not.
Events like Rwanda lay bare the failure of globalism the eventual salvation of whatever Tutsis that were left was thanks to other , armed Tutsis, that came over the border. Maybe Kuwait can thank the international community for rescuing it from Saddam, but the Kurds, who were immediately abandoned after Kuwait was liberated might have another view. (Inexplicably, the globalists thought leaving Saddam alive and in power was a good idea, and Saddam used the opportunity to secure his position, by killing loads of Kurds.)
Relative peace in the United States and the West, perhaps, but thats as far as it goes.
Having a realistic true history of the 20th century is critical, I think, because there is very little in it to support the notion that any of us can trust our safety and security to bureaucrats who reside thousands of miles away, unless, perhaps, they are bureaucrats working in the Pentagon.
So, in my conception of nationalism, I am going back to something which pre-dates even Darwinism. When the United States was founded, the individual states were essentially and effectively viewed as sovereign nations in their own right. On this republican (small r) view, the powers of the federation were narrowly construed, and the nationsthat is, American statesserved as an important check and balance on tyranny at the federation level.
I am a nationalist, in this sense, because I believe that in light of the realities of human history, extremely robust checks and balances are needed in every place where power is centered. Ultimately, the citizens of the many nations should be construed as the final check and balance, and should be armed in such a way that the tyrants really are afraid to over-reach. But what to do when other nations over-step and over-reach right into your own nation?
Well, in the past, one generally assumed that the people leading your own nation would put their foot down and attempt to protect the interests of the people who elected those leaders. But this is not the case when globalists run the show, especially when they are the ones at the steering wheel. Many examples could be given, but for the purpose of this post, Im going to use the corona virus to explain, with some reference to the ebola outreak about six years ago.
The reaction to the corona virus has, in my mind, generally shown the powerful way that nations can be a check and balance against other nations. It did not take very long for individual countries to start locking down their borders, quarantining people coming from suspected regions in China, etc., etc. Excellent. As it should be.
Given such events, we do begin to see some of the narrow instances where are our international organizations have value. These epidemics have an international component almost by definition. But it is one thing to let these people do their work and it is quite another to give them governance .
Why? Because they dont care about you , thats why. Well, not exclusively, anyway. To the globalist, your interests needs to be weighed against the interests of other peoples interests, and, naturally, they are in their mind perfectly suited to be the arbiter in such things.
Thus, for example, lets pretend that it was determined that it appeared there was going to be an outbreak leading to thousands of deaths in either region X or region Y. It could not be stopped. It was going to happen in one of these places. The only question was whether or not we could direct it to a particular region, and then actually do it. The globalist feels perfectly comfortable weighing the relative merits of each option. Perhaps they will not be quite happy that people in region X will suffer if region Y is spared, but again, on their view, it falls to them to be concerned about the people in both regions.
Now, if you happen to live in region X, you might feel altogether differently about it. It is your kids, your wife or husband, your livelihood, perhaps even your life on the line. It is you being asked to take the hit. And the globalist? Well, he doesnt answer to you, does he? You have no way to hold him accountable. You didnt elect him. You will probably never learn his name. What if the entire premise is wrongthat is to say, perhaps in point of fact, there is no reason to believe that it WAS going to happen in one of those two places in the first place. That is, the globalist was wrong .
Can you imagine that? A globalist being wrong? (The globalist cant believe it.) And to whom or to what can you appeal in that case?
If, in fact, there are significant checks and balances on the globalist and/or his institutions, the globalist can end up doing a lot of damage. The nationalist certainly can do a lot of damage, too. What is the only way to check either? Other nations.
In the Ebola incident, more than 11,000 people died . This is more than a third of all those believed to have been impacted. At present, almost the same number of people believed to have been infected (officially) is the same as in the Ebola incident (around 28,000) but there have only been a little over 500 deaths. [ This seems reliable enough .] It strikes me as strange that in the Ebola outbreak, amid calls to shut down travel from that region, etc, there were globalists who decried such measures as mean, despite the disease killing 1 out of every 3 individuals, whereas with the Corona Virus, no one really had to issue any calls to take action because everyonenations, international organizations, etc,took appropriate action immediately including shutting down travel from out of that region! This, when the Corona Virus, by comparison, is only killing (so far) 1 out of every 50 individuals. And no one accusing anyone for being mean!
Is it because the Chinese are not as lovable in the globalists eyes as the West Africans? I really dont know the answer, but it does strike me as odd.
The thing that really bothered me during the Ebola incident was the clear fact that the Globalist-in-Chief, Obama, seemed perfectly prepared to subsume the interests and welfare of the United States. The US was basically the region X from the scenario above. The nightmare was that the one actually elected to represent us didnt seemed to care all that much about us. And hence, a lesson about electing globalists to represent you.
There are many examples that I could give to expound on this, but the corona virus thing seems to illustrate one of the benefits of having nations led by people concerned for the people who have placed them into power. There is no hint that this time around there are going to be calls for a global kumbaya because individual countries are proactively defending their own citizens.
Might this mean that somewhere down the line we may have to rescue China? Perhaps. Im sure many a nationalist like myself will be happy to consider the prospects and act if necessary. What we dont like is being called upon to sacrifice our own lives, the lives of our loved ones, or our general welfare, by the very people who were supposed to represent us.
Indeed, in a case like this, it seems the oxygen mask analogy would be appropriate. When you are on an airplane, they counsel you to put the oxygen mask on yourself, first, before tending to those less able to fend for themselves. The reason for this is very simple: if they are less able to fend for themselves, they are less able to help YOU, if you falter. Thus, helping yourself first isnt merely being selfish of uncompassionate. By saving one (yourself), you increase the odds of saving both.
If healthier nations are asked to accept risks in order to dilute the risks to the other, less healthy nation, this could jeopardize our ability to help both.
Other examples abound, as I said. I am using the corona virus to illustrate.
But an aside before I move on.
I recently had a face to face conversation with a politician and the topic was oriented towards protecting the interests of my family. This politician, very earnest and genuine, hastened to remind me that he had to look after the interests of all the families in the area. This is the globalist spirit, writ smaller. You see, there are two ways of approaching such issues. In one approach, you recognize that you cant be everyones daddy, even if you wanted to, and so, being concerned (genuinely) for all the families in the area, you strive to equip ALL the parents so that they can do what they are best situated to dotend to their own families. In the other approach, you say, Well, there are families that will not have parents who can do their job, so, hell, I guess Ill just be everyones parent.
There is no argument with the former viewpoint. It is the second viewpoint where problems emerge. Practically speaking, nobody can be everyones daddy. The globalist pretends that he is intellectually, spiritually, and morally capable of balancing the unique needs and interests of every single person on the globe, and from his Godlike perch, able also to act appropriately. But, although he may not ever see the damage he does (he probably wont bother to look to see if he hurt someone along the way; for the globalist, only his good intentions matter, not the actual outcomes), there will be thousands of unanticipated consequences because, well, in point of fact, the globalist is NOT God.
One of the unanticipated (to them) consequences is that by acting to be everyones daddy, they necessarily enact and pursue policies which make it harder for actual fathers to appropriately protect their own family.
Consider a hypothetical to illustrate. Lets say that I lived in a flood zone. Being the proactive father that I am, lets say that I acquire a boat in order to get my family out of the area if it came to it. But my local globalist thinks its unfair that some people dont have boats in case of flooding. To solve the problem, he outlaws private ownership of boats, and creates an agency which is in charge of all the boats, which they will then dispatch as necessary. On paper, perhaps, this will help the overall community in case of a flood, but it has come at the expense of taking my boat. Now I dont have a boat if there is a flood. I cannot get them away and return in my boat to help others, because I have no boat.
And if my family drowns because the new agency fouled up in their responseor even if they acted effectively, but were constrained by circumstancesshould I be happy that I was asked to sacrifice my family so that other people, who had perfectly good opportunities to be proactive themselves, but didnt, could, theoretically, live?
Your globalists thinks you should be very happy. And why not? It isnt his family.
Many, many, many, many policies and viewpoints are advanced exactly along those lines. In the name of the community, they deprive, disarm, defund, etc, individuals. At least as long as there are such things as nations/states, counties, municipalities, and townships, etc, where there is a halfway decent chance of reflecting the actual interests of the actual people who elect them, there is a good chance that some seriously bad (totalitarian level) things never take place.
Thus, I am a nationalist, in just the same sense that I consider my home state to be a nation. Or, at least it used to be. With the steady encroachment of wanna-be-daddies over the last hundred years, even what we have is at risk. Someday, the globalists will foul it up so much that even they cant deny what happened. (Remember, as a general rule, they rarely investigate the outcomes of their policies). Can you imagine how many people will have suffered and died in order to catch their attention at last?
It makes me shudder to think of it. Anthony",FAKE,FAKE

According to the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, he also added that the prize sum also goes to whoever develops the vaccine for Lassa fever virus whose cases are reported in some states in the country.
The Minister spoke at the send-forth for a retiring Director of Chemical Technology Department of the Ministry, Engr. Akinyemi Oyefeso in the Ministry in Abuja on Thursday.
Dr. Onu further challenged Nigerian inventors, innovators and scientists to find a cure for various diseases that are proving intractable, adding that Nigeria is well-endowed with both human and material resources to surmount them. He further said that Nigerian Scientists are highly rated and expressed optimism that in no distant time, the country will make key contributions in so many areas of Science and Technology to the delight of the entire world.
Dr. Onu commended the celebrant, Engr. Akinyemi Oyefeso, for his various innovations when he held forth as a Director in the Ministry. We will need your expertise and service in future, because you have so much to offer the nation, he added.
He advised the entire staff and management of the Ministry to rise up to the challenge of a knowledge- based economy being stridently pursued by the present administration.

588,588,"Highlights - The Corona regional epidemic may potentially turn global - Many Chinese cities quarantined; trade, tourism &amp;amp; services hit - Market expecting replay of SARS of 2003 - Commodities-centric sectors with direct exposure to China under watch The Corona virus outbreak in China has emerged as the biggest global worry at the moment. This virus if not contained in time may turn into a global epidemic with adverse implications for travel, trade and markets alike. So far, 106 casualties have been reported  all in China  with nearly 4,600 confirmed cases of infected individuals. China has seen travel ban and quarantine measures that could impact local and global trade dynamics. While previous such crises had hurt global equities, a recovery thereafter has prompted investors to draw parallels. However, the potential damage to an already fragile global economy can be high as the treatment to Corona virus is still not available. Investors, hence, should stay cautious on the cyclical sectors. What is Corona? On December 31, 2019, the WHO (World Health Organisation) issued an alert about several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan  the capital of Hubei Province of China. The virus was termed as Corona virus (CoV), which belongs to a family of viruses that causes illness ranging from common cold to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. The strain has not been previously identified in humans and does not respond to any medical treatment so far. The Corona virus is understood to have been initially transmitted from animals (possibly snakes and bats) -- just as SARS that spread from civet cats, and MERS from camels. It is contagious and what makes the transmission difficult to contain at the initial stage is the fact that its incubation period i.e. time from exposure to developing symptoms is about 3-10 days. Researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London estimate that the number of actual infections may be 10 times more than the reported confirmed cases due to this incubation period. The immediate impact The official response started with the lockdown of Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million. As of now, 15 cities of the Hubei province are under similar travel quarantine controls. As the outbreak took place in the run-up to the holiday season, that is Chinese Lunar Year celebrations, the consumption and tourism cycle took a beating. Except for cities of the Hubei province, the impact on manufacturing is yet to be seen as a good set of businesses is anyway shut due to the Chinese New Year. Officially, Chinese holidays are extended to February 2 nationally and February 9 for Shanghai. Since a solution to the Corona virus is work in progress, it is anyones guess how long this crisis will stay and to what extent it can impact globally. So far, multiple countries have reported confirmed cases and are looking at measures ranging from isolating the infected person to a travel ban to China and other restrictions. According to the WHO, the current outbreak is still a regional crisis. Financial market impact Markets have started to price in the flu factor in an alarming way. Chinese equities have fallen by 5-6 percent from their January 20 highs. Oil has slumped by more than 10 percent in the past few days and gold is at its 6-year high. Looking at the SARS of 2003, the global macroeconomic impact was estimated at $30-100 billion. It was also estimated that the impact on Chinas GDP was as high as 1 percent. (Source: The Impacts on Health, Society, and Economy of SARS and H7N9 Outbreaks in China: A Case Comparison Study by Qiu, Chu &amp;amp; Mao). As far as its impact is concerned, Chinese equities had plunged about 8-10 percent during March-April 2003. Similarly, Mexico stocks during Swine Flu in 2009 and Brazilian equities during Zika in 2016 were moderately impacted by 2-4 percent. In all the cases, however, the equities recovered swiftly post the crises. The scale of the problem calls for a closer look at Ground Zero the Hubei province. At $595 billion, the province made up about 4 percent of Chinas GDP in 2018. Note that the Hubei province is an important center for industries such as metallurgy, automobiles, chemicals and optical electronics. The city of Wuhan constitutes about 1 percent of Chinas global trade dynamics  both exports and imports. Historically, known a major automobile and logistic centre, in last few years the city is also fastly emerging as a hi-tech hub for the optics industry. Takeaways In our base case, we believe that the Corona virus epidemic may have an impact limited to China with a likely extended quarantine and travel ban within the country. This stems from the fact that China this time is better equipped to deal with this crisis than earlier occasions. The recent quick steps may just prevent the problem getting global. In the short term, the adverse impact on Chinese GDP could be larger than earlier occasions due to the clampdown. Further, longer restrictions on travel and work will adversely impact Chinese consumption, services and manufacturing in the short run. Investors should look at this event with abundant caution. The positive trade outlook on account of of the Phase 1 trade deal between the US and China now faces a serious risk. Investors may turn cautious on sectors and companies with direct exposure to China, particularly on the commodities side. Sectors with links to oil such as chemicals and agrochemicals may have to brace for more volatility and potential high cost inventories. The ones that are dependent on raw materials from China like pharma, agrochemicals may face additional headwinds. Large export-oriented sectors of China such as metals and chemicals may possibly turn to higher dumping in India, particularly if there is lower domestic consumption of same. The recent correction in metal prices therefore comes as little surprise. Note that prior to this metal price outlook had turned positive on account of the improvement in the US-China trade ties.",FAKE,FAKE

It is considered that the 2019-nCoV outbreak has met the conditions for a WHO Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [1] .
The World Customs Organization (WCO) has been closely monitoring recent developments regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Following the 30 January meeting of the Emergency Committee, the WCO has been liaising with the WHO to ensure WCO Members with public health and safety responsibilities are properly informed about the situation and are involved in national response strategies.
At the level of borders, many WCO Members play an important role in national response strategies to mitigate epidemic-related public health and safety risks. Customs administrations are often countriesfirst and last lines of defence, and Customs officers are among the first government authorities to meet travellers and crew members on board arriving vessels, aircraft, and other types of transport. In this context, it is of utmost importance that Customs administrations with health and safety responsibilities are adequately integrated as part of the preparedness and preresponse mechanisms.
The WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. Members are invited to consult the Updated WHO advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV issued on 27 January 2020.

Author Dr. Jon Thomason shares research from the Moffitt Cancer Center, which pioneered research into this application of ultrasound, and he explains both how ultrasound works and how, more importantly, it can be used to as a treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and surgery are not the only options for patients suffering from cancer.

Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced it to reveal the epidemic. Concealment would be a serious blow to the governments credibility and might trigger greater social panic, the editorial said.

Coronavirus Advisory
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing.",TRUE,TRUE

The Real Story Behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus? conspiracy theory , Crisis Alert , Health and Fitness , Opinion There is a big story circulating around about the real story behind the 2019 Novel Corona Virus - COVID-19 . This story asks tons of questions and seems to point a finger at the United States for the current pandemic. Is it really true? Let's see. 16 questions on CV for US!! 1. Despite many Caucasians being in Wuhan, why did the virus appear only to attack Chinese or those with Chinese blood? At the moment we have no answer to this. Does it really attack only people with Chinese blood? Needs further proof. 2. Why was the coronavirus first reported outbreak 14 days after 300 US military personnel arrived in Wuhan for the Military World Games on October 19? The incubation period was 14 days. This is false. The first detected case of the Novel Corona Virus is on December 31, 2019. According to a CNN timeline, the first cases occur between December 12 and December 29, 2019 as per Wuhan Municipal Health. ( Source 1 | Source 2 ) As for the Military World Games, it indeed happened in Wuhan China. ( Source 1 | Source 2 ) 3. Why did Harvard collect DNA of Chinese people in China a year ago under a research project? According to an article in the New York Times, ""China Uses DNA to Trackl Its People, With the Help of American Expertise. The Chinese authorities turned to a Massachusetts company and a prominent Yale researcher as they built an enormous system of surveillance and control. So technically, China is the one collecting the DNA and not the US. ( Source ) 4. Why and how did a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canadas NML biological labs end up in China in March 2019? There is a legitimate article published on a Canadian Public News Agency telling the story of a breach in the National Microbilogy Lab (NML) in Winnipeg. A researcher with ties to China was recently escorted out of the National Microbiology Lab (NML) in Winnipeg amid an RCMP investigation into what's being described as a possible ""policy breach."" Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, her husband Keding Cheng and an unknown number of her students from China were removed from Canada's only level-4 lab on July 5, CBC News has learned. ( Source ) 5. Why did US withdraw or evacuate its embassy workers and staff based in Wuhan immediately after the Military Game in end Oct? There is no news regarding this. The only real evacuation happened after the outbreak of the virus. (Source) 6. Why did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Predict Up To 65 Million Deaths Via Coronavirus in Sept 2019? Coincidence? The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. ( Source ) 7. The virus resembles virus from a rare South African bat, a cobra and other kind of sea creature. How such a virus end up in Wuhan - South African bat? According to a Research Journal, the source of the genetic sequences of the novel corona virus is 99% similar to the genetic sequences of viruses isolated from Pangolins Scientists say that the suggestion, based on genetic analysis, seems plausible  but caution that the researchers work is yet to be published in full. This is an extremely interesting observation. Although we need to see more details, it does make sense as there are now some other data emerging that pangolins carry viruses that are closely related to 2019-nCoV, says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney, Australia. ( Source ) More Questions About the Novel Corona Virus Here are more questions about the 2019 Novel Corona Virus which we ought to verify or perhaps you can help us answer and verify them. 8. How did the viruses jump species barriers over 3 animals without human assistance? 9. Why the outbreaks happen after the failure of US sponsored attacks in HK and Xinjiang? 10. Why the outbreak happened after some virus attacked the pig and chicken farming in China? 11. Who spread and attacked the pigs in China? Report mentioned a droid was used to spray viruses on the pigs. 12. Why did US immediately start spreading rumours via its media that China stole US virus and accidentally leaked it in Wuhan? But the facility in Wuhan is NOT a military or development facility. 13. Why this happened in china when Only US holds the Patent For An Attenuated Coronavirus which was Filed In 2015 And Granted In 2018? 14. Why a large number of the initial victims were not related to and never been to the wet market in Wuhan? Was it really the originator? 15. What and why did US bury biohazards containers in the US evacuated consulate in Wuhan? 16. Why was US leaders, politicians and media immediate reactions and line of questions on China when the outbreak was announced so aligned and similar? Was there already an agreement prior to the outbreak was announced? 2019 Novel Corona Virus is Due to a Chinese Lab Containment Error? Another detailed articles walks through certain events and circumstances about the virus. This is very detailed and the author itself says that this theory might be very plausible. A study published on the Lancet finds no connection to the wet food market in 13 of the initial infected.  the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

In one ongoing study, the Korean Center for Disease Control found that 100% of 25 randomly selected patients who were hospitalized with symptoms and who fully recovered, developed defensive antibodies against COVID-19.
Researchers were initially concerned that antibodies might not kill the virus, because roughly half of patients had both antibodies and a current COVID-19 infection.

(Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images, FILE) More Further investigation, however, suggested that the virus scientists detected might have been dead or so weak that it couldn't infect others.
In a second study of more than 10,700 COVID-19 patients, researchers examined 207 individuals who were re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering from their infections.
In 39 of those 207 re-diagnosed individuals, researchers did not find any virus replication in patient samples they analyzed.
In other words, the new research suggests that if a patient is re-diagnosed with COVID-19 after recovering, it's unlikely he or she will be able to infect others.
Still, the KCDC cautioned, it's unclear how long those antibodies last. Until we have that key piece of data, the jury is still out on whether mass immunity is possible.

624,624,"For fun were going to use some logic as it relates to the Corona Virus in China. Instead of fear mongering, we think the USA will probably be in good shape, that said if we look at the numbers the other countries near Asia do not make sense. There is a wide range of opinions including people who think its the black plague (not even close) and people who think it should be compared to the common flu (no ability to understand statistics). Well attempt to put some numbers and predictions around this.
High-Level: From a top down view you can assume that it is a pretty deadly disease. Not because of the current numbers (35,000 confirmed and 725 deaths) but because of the precautions that have been taken. When the US was attacked in Baghdad they didnt bother flying the US leaders out. Yet Were evacuating important people located in China. Add to this the fact that China has locked down ~400M people (at least attempting to keep it locked down) which is more than the population of the USA and Canada combined. Even during the SARS outbreak the level of restrictions was not this high.
We can make a few conclusions, the severity of the disease is 100x+ higher than any foolish comparison to the flu. Youll get the flu at least a few times during your life and the chances of dying are in the basis points (less if youre under the age of 60 or so). This new virus has a death rate of about 2%+ and you have to add in bodies that were found before they could be tested. Therefore an easy conclusion here is that this is a serious illness that is not currently contained. We can prove out that it is not currently contained because of the rapid growth. Therefore, conclusion number 1 is that this is a serious infection.
Current Numbers: The second item to be aware of is the growth of confirmed cases. It appears to be growing at a 10% rate or so per day. This is likely an understated number since it is reaching a point where testing this many people has a lot of errors in it . If you live in a major city, imagine trying to take 20,000 of them and test them all in a day or two. It doesnt make a lot of sense and we know China is certainly understating the number. The more important number to track is actually the number of cases outside of Hubei. Only a few weeks ago most cases were largely contained in that particular province but now were looking at 25,000 people (according to the latest data) which results in 10,000 total cases outside of the primary infection point.
You can manually track places outside of Hubei with this website.
So what should you actually track? You should really track numbers in areas like Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Why? Well these countries have extremely low cases despite being popular areas to visit and quite close to China. Its extremely unlikely that Singapore with 33 confirmed cases and Thailand with only 32 makes a lot of sense. There is a lot more traffic from Wuhan to Thailand. Instead if you are in Singapore you should be happy about the higher number of confirmed cases because it means your government has adequate technology to lock down and test everyone coming in. Another great example is actually Japan, while people are scared of the number of cases found on the cruise ship, you can conclude that they are taking the right measures and have adequate testing to prevent a rapid outbreak. Just take a look below.
If you look at the rough numbers from the table, why would Thailand have an equal number of cases relative to Singapore? It doesnt make a lot of logical sense. And. The ability to simply go to Thailand is easy (without the flight data) so the chances that Thailand is behind the correct number is high. Wed wager that Thailand will end up being one of the countries with a mini outbreak at this time. The fact that Australia has half as many cases as Thailand should be another clear indicator that they are behind. And. Well add that Mongolia having zero cases is questionable given the close location.
Some Good News: If youre in the USA, Europe even Korea, Japan and Singapore, youre pretty much good to go. The chances of having a mass outbreak in an advanced country is low. Advanced countries will be able to correctly identify the right people and increase safety for the general public. Wed be extremely surprised to see an outbreak in a major US city. Within a month or so we think the issues in Japan/Korea/Singapore will be solved /contained. The real issue appears to be in the third world countries that are located near China. The second piece of good news is that you really shouldnt cancel any flights to an area outside of Asia. The virus does not live long on seats. You simply want to avoid going to China for a while and avoid the third world Asian countries as an extra precautionary measure.
Current Predictions: This wouldnt be fun if we didnt put out some predictions on the issue. The first one is that the total outbreak number will certainly exceed 100,000+ at some point. That is pretty likely given the spread to low-tech third world countries. The second one is that China will not solve the issue in 14 days. We think the chances of a 14 day slow down is next to none. This likely goes on past the month of February at a minimum and into March. By the time that the issue is contained we would then add another 4-6 months before tourism goes back to normal. It is unlikely that people suddenly decide to go back to China after something this large occurs, particularly if the infected cases clears 100K.
On the positive side of things, we think this will probably peak in about a month. This means the major countries will have it contained. No major outbreaks in Singapore, USA, Europe, Australia, Japan or Taiwan. This is not going to last forever thats for sure and we wont be hearing about it by the end of the year (if we do it was a catastrophe). As a rough estimate well go ahead and wager that the mortality/death rate will be around 2%, it seems to be stabilizing in this area and since most numbers are fudged it means 3% is more likely. This is a pretty serious issue for diseases for those that looked up mortality rates of other viruses.
Some Conclusions: The first conclusion is to certainly avoid Asia for a bit if you planned on going. If you must go certainly avoid China (for now at least). It isnt worth the risk for a 2% death rate. The second conclusion is that panicking in the USA is a bit humorous, youre not going to do much with a face mask. The size of the disease particles is actually smaller than the protective mask can prevent (yes we looked this all up). You might accidentally increase your chances of getting it since the particles can stick to the mask as you inhale.
If you want to be extra careful, you can reduce your travel to the regions near China as well but wed wager that the major countries will have things under control. If you want to track it more seriously, we would look at every third world country and province outside if Hubei. Thats the major issue at this time as no one in their right mind is flying into Wuhan. Hopefully, this came out as somewhat balanced, we cant believe the headlines that this is similar to the flu. Weve seen too many media headlines trying to say not a big deal which is the exact opposite of what they did during the financial crisis. So its best to assume its worse than mainstream media, worse than Chinese media and *better* than hysteria in the USA/abroad. The face mask business in the USA is booming for no reason (if youre in the face mask business congrats on the extra sales!)

The flood of diseases is caused by a novel corona virus called 2019-nCoV, which has now infected over 34,000 Chinese citizens and has claimed more than 720 lives. The disease was first reported on New Year's Eve and in the World Health Organization. The interim month was associated with a family of viruses known as ""coronaviruses"", with the same family, which is responsible for SARS and the respiratory syndrome in the vicinity East as well as some cases of cold is responsible.
There are no approved treatments for coronaviruses, but on February 6, China enrolled a small number of patients in a clinical trial with Remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug from the American pharmaceutical company Gilead that has not yet been approved for use but proved to be promising in laboratory studies. ""While there is currently no antiviral data for remdesivir showing activity against 2019-nCoV, the data available in other coronaviruses gives us hope,"" Gilead said in a statement.
On January 30, a special WHO committee declared an emergency in the area of public health to be internationally worrying. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of China, including the United States, where leading agencies around the world are beginning to restrict travel and enforce quarantines to prevent the spread.

Now Playing: Deadly Corona Virus Detected in the United States
1:41 What is a corona virus?
Coronaviruses belong to a family known as Coronaviridae and look like spiked rings under an electron microscope. They are named after these spines, which form a halo or ""crown"" around their viral envelope.
Coronaviruses contain a single strand of RNA in the envelope and cannot multiply as a virus without penetrating living cells and hijacking their machinery. The spikes on the virus envelope help corona viruses bind to cells, which gives them a way to open the door with C4. Inside, they transform the cell into a virus factory and use their molecular conveyor belt to produce more viruses, which are then transported out of the cell. The virus progeny infect other cells and the cycle starts again.
These types of viruses typically occur in animals, which range from farm animals and domestic animals to wild animals such as bats. Some are responsible for diseases like colds. When jumping to people, they can cause fever, respiratory problems, and inflammation in the lungs. In immunocompromised people, such as the elderly or people with HIV-AIDS, such viruses can cause serious respiratory diseases that lead to pneumonia and even death.
Extremely pathogenic coronaviruses have been outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) in the past two decades. These viruses were easily transmitted from person to person. SARS, which occurred in the early 2000s, infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths. MERS, which emerged in the early 2010s, infected nearly 2,500 people and resulted in more than 850 deaths. Where did the virus come from?
The virus appears to have its origins in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 950 kilometers south of Beijing, where more than 11 million people live. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells fish as well as meat from other animals, including bats, snakes, and pangolins, was involved in the spread in early January.
The renowned medical journal The Lancet published a comprehensive summary of the clinical features of patients infected with the disease, which date back to December 1, 2019. The very first patient identified was not exposed to the market, suggesting that the virus may have come from another place and was marketed there.
Chinese authorities closed the fish market on January 1.
Markets have been involved in the emergence and spread of viral diseases in previous epidemics, including SARS and MERS. A large majority of people who have confirmed that they are infected with the new corona virus have been in the Huanan Seafood market in recent weeks. The market appears to be an integral part of the puzzle, but researchers continue to test and research the original cause.
In an early report published on January 22 in the Journal of Medical Virology, snakes were suspected to be the most likely wildlife reservoir for 2019-nCoV, but the work was stopped only a day later on January 22 January, thoroughly refuted by two other studies Here is a study that refutes the evidence for the snake as a #Coronavirus reservoir. Suspected that the closest coronavirus relatives are found in bats (bats were also seen as a reservoir for SARS in 2003).  ""We haven't seen enough evidence to point to a snake reservoir for the Wuhan corona virus (2019- nCoV), ""said Peter Daszak, president of the non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, which examines the relationships between human and animal health.
""This work is really interesting, but when we compare the genetic sequence of this new virus with all other known coronaviruses, all of the closest relatives are from mammals, especially bats. It looks like we haven't got any closer to the markets, to know the natural reservoir of this virus. ""
Another group of Chinese scientists uploaded a paper to the preprint website biorXiV after examining the viral genetic code and comparing it with the previous SARS corona virus and other bat corona viruses , They discovered the profound genetic similarities: the virus shares 80% of its genes with the previous SARS virus and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses. It is important that the study also showed that the virus can enter and kidnap cells in the same way as SARS.
All good scientific knowledge builds on previous discoveries  and there's still more to learn about the basic biology of 2019-nCoV before we know exactly which animal vector is responsible for transmission  but early signs are the virus similar to bats. A January 28 New York Times report suggested that the Chinese horseshoe bat could be a culprit. How many confirmed cases have been reported?
The authorities confirmed over 34,000 cases on February 7.
In the United States, 12 cases were confirmed: six in California, two in Illinois and one each in Washington, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Arizona. Canada has four confirmed cases.
A cruise ship stationed in front of the Japanese port of Yokohama was quarantined after it was found that a passenger traveling on board was infected with 2019-nCoV. On February 6, Japan confirmed that 61 people on the ship had tested positive for the novel corona virus.
Over 27,000 people were suspected on February 7. According to CGTN a Chinese media service, the number of recovered patients in China has risen to over 2,000.
Here is the current breakdown: China: 34,582 confirmed cases (Hong Kong: 26; Macau: 10) Singapore : 30 confirmed cases South Korea: 24 confirmed cases [19659041] Taiwan: 16 confirmed cases Australia: 15 confirmed cases USA: 12 confirmed cases [19659041] Malaysia: 12 confirmed cases Vietnam: 10 confirmed cases United Arab Emirates: 5 cases Canada: 5 confirmed cases India: 3 confirmed cases Cases Philippines: 3 confirmed cases Gro United Kingdom: 2 confirmed cases Italy: 2 confirmed cases Sri Lanka: 1 confirmed case Tibet: 1 confirmed case Sweden: 1 confirmed case Belgium: 1 confirmed case
You can use this practical online tool to track the spread of the virus . It collects data from various sources, including the CDC, WHO and Chinese health experts. (Note: Our reports and tracking tool may differ.) How many deaths have been reported?
As of February 7, the death toll was 724.
One death was recorded outside of China. A man who traveled to Wuhan in January and returned to the Philippines died on February 1. A second death outside of China was reported Tuesday after a 39-year-old man died in Hong Kong. How do we know that this is a new corona virus?
In short, science!
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention sent a team of scientists to Wuhan to collect information about the new disease and test it on patients in hopes of isolating the virus. Her work published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 24, examined samples from three patients. Using an electron microscope that can resolve images of cells and their internal mechanics and examine the genetic code, the team was able to make the novel corona virus visible and genetically identify it.
Understanding the genetic code helps researchers in two ways: it enables them to create tests that identify the virus from patient samples, and it gives them potential insight into how to create treatments or vaccines.
In addition, the Peter Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, was able to identify and breed the virus in a laboratory using a patient sample. They announced their discovery on January 28th. This is considered one of the biggest breakthroughs in the development of a vaccine, giving laboratories the opportunity to assess health authorities and provide expert information, as well as to identify the virus in patients suspected of harboring the disease. How does the corona virus spread?
This is one of the main questions that researchers are still working hard to answer. The first infections may have been the result of an animal-to-human transmission, but it was confirmed in late January that human-to-human transmission had occurred.
The University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported that health workers in China had been infected with the virus in late January. This was a remarkable turning point during the SARS epidemic, as health workers who moved between countries could help spread the disease.
""The biggest problem is hospital outbreaks that have occurred with SARS and MERS corona viruses,"" said C. Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. ""Careful triage and infection control is required to prevent these outbreaks and to protect health workers.""
According to a BBC report citing Chinese officials, there is some evidence that the virus can spread before symptoms appear . The incubation period  when the virus accumulates in the body  can last from one to 14 days without a patient realizing that he is infected. However, it must be emphasized that experts are still not sure how contagious this period is.
On February 5, Chinese state media reported that a newborn was diagnosed with nCoV 30 hours after birth in 2019, which opens up the possibility of mother-to-child transmission. Viruses can be transmitted through the placenta, but experts say it is too early to say whether this is the case with the novel coronavirus, which is ""unlikely"" to be transmitted in the womb. How does the world fight spread?
In Wuhan, authorities hurried to build a thousand-bed hospital to treat coronavirus patients as the province struggles with hospital bed shortages. It started admitting patients on February 4th.
China closed Wuhan to reduce the spread of the virus and canceled the transportation that left the city at 10:00 am on January 23. Travel restrictions were extended to four other cities (Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang), and on January 24, eight other cities announced restrictions that affected more than 35 million people.
Restrictions were enforced for China during a busy travel season, when citizens typically travel on Lunar New Year. Major Public Events The Chinese capital Beijing was canceled, and both the Forbidden City in Beijing and Disneyland in Shanghai were closed on January 25th. All restrictions and closings will apply indefinitely.
The scale of global efforts to contain the disease is immense . Hong Kong closed many public institutions on January 28, preventing travel between mainland China. The United States announced extensive border control measures at 20 ports of entry and was considering canceling flights to and from the Wuhan outbreak epicenter. Esports tournaments have been postponed, Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland have been closed, women's Olympic soccer tournaments have been postponed completely, and McDonald's has closed thousands of places across China where the virus is spreading.
British Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China ""for the next few days"" on January 29, a spokesman confirmed by email. American Airlines and Delta will also discontinue flight to mainland China, but Delta will be offering flights to customers wishing to leave China by February 5. Australian carrier Qantas announced that flights from Sydney to Beijing and Sydney to Shanghai will be discontinued on February 9. The New Zealand airline Air New Zealand discontinued daily flights to Shanghai on February 1st.
Cruise ships announced on February 7, Royal Caribbean that entry would be denied for ""all passport holders in China, Hong Kong and Macau regardless of their residence"". It is also impossible for anyone to travel to China, Hong Kong or Macau in the 15 days before boarding. and anyone who has come within two meters of someone from China, Hong Kong or Macau 15 days earlier; and everyone with fever or low blood oximetry. Norwegian Cruise Line will deny entry to anyone who has traveled to China, Hong Kong and Macau within 30 days of the cruise and anyone who has a passport from these locations.
On January 31, US Secretary of Health Alex Azar declared a public health emergency referring to the nation's intent to protect and respond to the outbreak while finding that "" the risk to Americans remains low. ""Australia and Japan followed. On February 4, the UK Department of State and French Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned citizens to evacuate China to reduce the risk of infection. How contagious is the corona virus?
A widely used Twitter topic by Eric Feigl-Ding an epidemiologist at Harvard University, suggests that the new coronavirus is based on a metric poorly known as a ""thermonuclear pandemic level""""r nothing"" (R0) value. This metric helps determine the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. In the simplest sense, the value refers to how many people can be infected with the disease by a person. It has been criticized many times before
Infectious diseases such as measles have a remarkably high R0 value from 12 to 18. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 had an R0 of around 3. A handful of studies that modeled the outbreak of 2019-nCoV gave a similar value, with a range between 1.4 and 3.8, but there are large differences between studies and models trying to test the R0 of the novel coronavirus due to d he can predict constantly changing number of cases.
In the early stages of understanding and spreading the disease, it should be emphasized that these studies are informative but not final. They give an indication of the potential of the disease to move from person to person, but we still don't have enough information about how the new virus spreads.
""Some experts say it's the most infectious virus ever seen  that's not true,"" said MacIntyre. ""If it was highly contagious (more contagious than influenza, as suggested by some), we should have seen hundreds, if not thousands, of cases outside of China now that Wuhan is a major transportation hub.""
China has suggested that the virus can spread before symptoms appear. In The Conversation of January 28, MacIntyre wrote that there was no evidence to support these claims, but that children and teenagers could be contagious without symptoms. This also reduces the impact of airport screenings, as the disease is native, but there is no evidence that it can spread insidiously. Should You Be Worried?
As the virus spreads, it is easy to get caught up in the fear and alarmism that is rife on social media. There is misinformation and misinformation about the effects of the disease where it spread and how. Experts are still warning that the virus appears to be mild, especially when compared to other viruses such as influenza or measles.
CNET has reviewed some rumors and myths that have spread. WHO declares public health emergency
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency that raised international concern about the outbreak of the coronavirus. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization is working with national and international health partners to manage the outbreak.

631,631,"Pulses amounting to 1 kg per family which was announced as part of the COVID-19 relief package about a month ago to the beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) are yet to reach many homes in the economically poor sections of the country.
According to an Indian Express report, hardly 19,496 ton out of the total monthly allocation of 1.95 lakh metric ton (LMT) pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY), have been issued by the states till April 22, revealed the data compiled by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. The ministry is involved in monitoring the supply of essential items during the nationwide lockdown.
The responsibility of ensuring the supply of pulses from the buffer stocks has been given to the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), which is under the administrative control of the Agriculture Ministry.
The Finance Ministry stated in a statement on ""Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Progress So Far"" on April 23 stated that ""1,09,227 MT of Pulses have also been dispatched"" to various states and Union Territories (UTs).
The Food Ministry&apos;s data, however, revealed that against a monthly allocation of 1,95,531 MT pulses under PMGKAY, to provide pulses free of cost to 19.55 crore families under NFSA, only 1,22,312 MT have been issued to states. The data further shows that out of this, 44,932 MT have been sent to ""destination"" states, 34,768 MT received by these states, and only 19,496 MT distributed to the beneficiaries.
Despite the announcement of PMGKAY on March 26, a day after PM Modi announced nationwide lockdown to contain novel coronavirus, the apathy in distribution is due to delay in the milling process by NAFED, sources in the Food Ministry have informed.
""We have to distribute free pulses to 19.55 crore families for three months across all 36 states and UTs. In big states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the number of eligible beneficiaries is quite high and, therefore, the allocation is high, (so) we are taking some time,"" a senior official of NAFED was Quote: d as saying. He added that NAFED is sending pulses to these states.
According to the official pulses have been dispatched to UTs such as Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Puducherry and Chandigarh, and smaller states such as Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura. ""Buffer stock of pulses is always kept un-milled (whole), and the milling process takes some time,"" the official further said.
The central nodal agency for procurement of notified agricultural commodities, including pulses, NAFED is under the Price Support Scheme run by the Agriculture Ministry.
The agency also maintains a buffer stock of pulses under the Price Stabilisation Fund Scheme administered by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
Earlier the Food Ministry officials had flagged a slow response in the supply of pulses to the states. The Cabinet Secretary is learnt to have directed the concerned officials from the Agriculture Ministry and NAFED to speed up supply.
""To ensure adequate availability of protein to all the above-mentioned individuals, 1 kg pulses per family would be provided according to regional preferences for the next three months. These pulses would be provided free of cost by the Government of India.,"" the government stated in a statement issued on March 26.",FAKE,FAKE

Both patients are confined in isolation rooms in separate hospitals in Cebu City. CDN Digital has censored the names of the hospitals in compliance with the doctor-patient confidentiality clause.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III disclosed that a total of 11 suspected 2019-nCoV cases have been under the radar of DOH since January 12, 2020. He said that presently, the country is still free from any confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strain.
Most of the persons-under-investigation (PUIs) , seven out of 11, are admitted in various hospitals in the Visayas  three in Western Visayas, three in Central Visayas (including the 5-year-old who tested negative of 2019-nCoV), and one in Eastern Visayas.
All PUIs in Central Visayas are from Cebu.
Duque said the PUIs consists of Chinese nationals, Brazilians, a German, and an American  all of whom have traveled to Wuhan City in Hubei province in Central China.
The 2019-nCoV originated in Wuhan City, a major transportation hub in mainland China with a population of 11 million.
Duque added that the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) is now conducting laboratory tests of the samples or specimens from seven of the 11 PUIs. He also said the other four have yielded different results but tested negative on previously known coronavirus strains such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars-CoV).

The Indian government arranged for the evacuation of 366 Indian citizens from Wuhan in a special Air India flight on 31 January 2020. The passengers are placed under quarantine for a period of 14 days.
A second batch of passengers, including seven Maldivan citizens evacuated by the government, arrived from Wuhan on 01 February 2020. The repatriated passengers are currently being monitored. India has evacuated 645 passengers as of 11 February. The health condition of all of them is being monitored on a daily basis. Coronavirus screening, testing and quarantining at Indian airports
Thermal screening has been installed at 21 airports including those in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Cochin to check for coronavirus in India.
Universal screening has been mandated for flights from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand at the aero-bridges ear-marked for the purpose.
Travellers with symptoms of the infection are being separated by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfares Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and directed to isolation facilities. The IDSP has been testing their samples.
The Ministry of Health announced on 06 February that all 645 evacuees from Wuhan tested negative.

With China under lockdown, India is expected to witness a major impact on imports and exports in various industries including pharmaceuticals, electronics, mobiles, and auto parts.
China is the biggest exporter to India, followed by the US and UAE. In 2018, China exported goods worth $90.4bn to India and accounted for 14.63% of the exports.
In 2017, telecom instruments, electronics components, computer hardware and peripherals, industrial machinery for dairy, and organic chemicals were the top five items imported by India accounting for 46% of the imports from China. How the Covid-19 outbreak impacts the Indian pharmaceutical industry
Bulk drugs and drug intermediates accounted for $1.5bn or 3% of Indias imports from China.
According to the Trade Promotion Council of India, approximately 85% of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) imported by Indian companies are from China.
Indias overdependence on China for APIs exposes it to raw material supply disruption and price volatility. Another major hindrance to the Indian pharmaceutical industry is its low capacity utilisation, according to a report from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI). India has a capacity utilisation between 30% and 40% as against 75% of China. Opportunities for Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers
Although the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could have a significant impact on the Indian pharmaceutical industry unless it is brought under control over the next few months, it also provides an opportunity to Indias pharmaceutical manufacturers to grab share from their Chinese competitors.
Indian pharmaceutical companies currently have two months stock of APIs and intermediates, quoted the Economic Times. In the absence of a major disruption due to the outbreak, the existing stocks may address the issue of shortage, it added.
The report from MCI, however, noted that improving the overall capacity utilisation of existing manufacturing plants in India as a short-term solution to such supply disruptions. The report noted the need for assured purchase agreements from the government for the existing manufacturing plants.
It also noted that the government should absorb the price differential to improve capacity utilisation. Coronavirus disease in India: Approved treatments

February 5, 2020
Adobe
As the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV increases each day, scientists around the world are racing to find a treatment. Since the virus was first reported from Wuhan, China, at the end of December, and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern on Jan. 30, commitments to fund research and development efforts are being made by governments , research institutes , partnerships and companies .
As the clock ticks, we should take a moment to realize we are witnessing something quite remarkable: The impressive speed with which science about 2019-nCoV is being shared.
From the day of the outbreaks first report, it took little more than one week for the World Health Organization to confirm the existence of the new coronavirus and for Chinese scientists to publish its genetic sequence . Think back to 2003 when it took more than two months for the sequence of the coronavirus that causes SARS to be shared with the world.
advertisement
The speed with which the sequence of 2019-nCoV has been shared is a potent reminder of how we should avoid tying up the research community in red tape when we are in a race to find a new vaccine or treatment for a new virus or other pathogen.
Coronavirus Coverage: Read the rest of STATs up-to-the-minute reporting on the coronavirus outbreak. But that is precisely what a legally binding international agreement, the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing , has inadvertently ended up doing. This supplementary international agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity could make it extraordinarily difficult to conduct disease surveillance or forge research collaborations around the world.
The Nagoya Protocol has the laudable aim of giving each country sovereignty over its biological resources. But this could hinder, or even prevent, the global collaboration required to find new treatments or vaccines. Today, more and more countries are moving towards enacting the Nagoya Protocol in national legislation, interpreting it in a way that requires sharing of pathogen samples and their information to be subject to negotiation between two parties.
Had China followed Nagoya Protocol requirements following the discovery of 2019-nCov, it could have embarked on discussions with each country, one by one, about how to share the sequence of this pathogen. That runs counter to WHO guidance on managing ethical issues in outbreaks: Rapid data sharing is critical during an unfolding health emergency. The ethically appropriate and rapid sharing of data can help identify etiological factors, predict disease spread, evaluate existing and novel treatments, symptomatic care and preventive measures, and guide the deployment of limited resources.
As The Lancet put it in a Jan. 24 editorial on the novel coronavirus that I firmly endorse, Openness and sharing of data are paramount. There are enormous demands for rapid access to information about this new virus, the patients and communities affected, and the response. But equally crucial is the need to ensure that those data are reliable, accurate, and independently scrutinized.
The inclusion of pathogens (as a genetic resource) under the Nagoya Protocol was not directly addressed in the final text of the protocol. It was left to each party to pay due regard to potential public health risks when implementing legislation.
This has led to increasing confusion and lack of alignment on implementing the Nagoya Protocol. Some countries do not include pathogens in the protocol. Others do, which has led to delays and disruption in the comprehensive sharing of samples of seasonal influenza and related genetic sequence information. Sharing such information is key to enabling researchers and manufacturers to identify and produce the necessary diagnostics, vaccines, and other treatments that contribute to a rapid response to epidemics and pandemics.
In other words, the potential of the Nagoya Protocol for adverse impacts on infectious disease prevention, timely epidemic response and, ultimately, global health security, is quite significant.
Related: In the race to develop a coronavirus treatment, Regeneron thinks it has the inside track As the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a research-based biopharmaceutical industry body with official relations with the United Nations, I support the Convention on Biological Diversity, which has three laudable objectives: conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources. But protecting the biodiversity of pathogens seems a perversion of the original aims of the convention.
Pathogens know no borders, so any obstacle to sharing them and/or their associated information will hinder essential global collaborations with the private and public sectors needed to develop effective countermeasures to disease outbreaks.
The GISAID Initiative aims to promote the international sharing of human and animal virus data. It has played a critical role in centralizing the collection of coronavirus sequences so they can be quickly and comprehensively shared with the international community  thanks to the credibility the initiative has gained in more than a dozen years of sharing the sequences of influenza viruses. In so doing it has won the trust and confidence that all parties are working together to share sequences fairly and follow the scientific etiquette of acknowledging the source of the data.
I believe it is in the worlds best interests to promote trust and fairness for the sake of global public health by making the sharing of pathogens and associated information swift and predictable.
It is time to question the sense of retaining pathogens within the scope of the Nagoya Protocol and associated national legislation. It is surely in the overriding interest of global public health and epidemic and pandemic preparedness for the international community to work towards an effective and internationally coherent approach to exempt pathogens from the protocol.",TRUE,FAKE

683,683,"Last week, the World Health Organization said it may take 18 months to get the corona virus vaccine for widespread use. First, we must understand the characteristics and behavior of the virus on the host body.
Lets find out why it takes so much time, despite the worldwide communitys efforts to produce the vaccine.
Since the first half of January, China has fully shared information about the RNA sequence of this virus, from which the whole world began to research and develop vaccines.
In late January, the virus was first successfully cultivated outside of China, at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. This is an important step, because for the first time researchers in other countries have access to a live virus sample. Thanks to this, they began to understand the characteristics of the virus, which is another important step in the development of vaccines.
So far, it takes 2 to 5 years to develop vaccines. But with global efforts, as well as lessons learned from previous corona vaccine developments, the researchers hope to develop this vaccine in a much shorter time.
Why do we need to cooperate?
Not only one research institute has the capacity and equipment to develop a vaccine.
First, we must understand the characteristics and behavior of viruses on the host (human).
Next, we have to prove that the test vaccine is safe and that we can create the right immunity of the body, not the wrong immunity that harms the body. Only then can the pre-clinical experiments be started on animals.
Vaccines that have been pre-clinical tested successfully will be tested by other institutions capable of testing the human body.
It will be decided by who, where to proceed. In general, it is best to test these vaccines in areas where outbreaks are occurring.
Finally, if a vaccine is judged safe and effective, it will need to be legally approved. Then there must be a cost-effective way to produce the vaccine so that it is ready to be distributed.
Each of the aforementioned steps of the vaccine development process presents many challenges.
Some challenges
In order to determine the characteristics of the virus, then the preclinical test vaccine trial first needs to isolate the virus, followed by cultivating a larger amount of virus so that the scientists have enough virus for further research . This includes virus culture in the laboratory under security and aseptic conditions.
The next challenge is to develop and validate virus biological samples. This will be an animal model that tells us how corona virus works in the human body.
From the results of the SARS outbreak in 2003, which is a ""family"" of the new corona virus, the scientists have a lot of experience to study this virus. For SARS, the researchers used the ferret-model animal as the experimental biological model. The two new strains of SARS and corona virus have the same gene codes of about 80 - 90%, so the ferret test results can be used as a starting point for further study of the new corona virus.
If the virus mutates, what will the vaccine do?
It is very likely that the new corona virus will evolve (mutate). As a virus in an animals body, it can mutate when it spreads from the first animal host to the next host, then spreads from animals to humans.
Initially it was not spread from person to person, but now it is spread from person to person very quickly. Spread from person to person demonstrates that the virus is undergoing a stable step, which is part of the mutation process.
Mutation processes can still change in different parts of the world for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is population density. Population density affects the number of people infected with the virus and the number of chances for the virus to mutate. Exposure to other corona viruses may also affect the ability of the population to infect, resulting in the emergence of different strains of the virus, similar to the condition of seasonal flu.
Therefore, it is essential that we continue to work with the latest versions of the virus to have the greatest chance that the vaccine will work.
All this work needs to be done under strict quality and safety conditions to ensure global legal requirements and safety for researchers as well as the community.
Challenges ahead
Another challenge is producing proteins from viruses to develop experimental vaccines. These proteins are specifically designed to enable an immune response when activated, allowing a persons immune system to fight the next time the virus is attacked.
Fortunately, recent scientific advances in understanding the viral proteins as well as their structure and function have helped the vaccine research and development work take place globally at a rapid pace. significantly fast.
Developing a vaccine is a huge task, not an overnight result. But if everything goes according to plan, this time we will shorten the time compared to before.
We have learned a lot from the SARS outbreak, and the knowledge of the global scientific community gained from SARS vaccination efforts has given us a good start to developing vaccines. Please prevent new corona virus this time.",FAKE,TRUE

704,704,"escorted by public security officers, 8 transgenic mice for fully human antibodies immunized with antigen from 2019 nCoV from Rongchang District, Chongqing were brought by Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. to Nanjing . These ""anti-2019 nCoV"" mice are provided to GenScript Biologics Development Business Unit (now known as GenScript ProBio) for emergency antibody drug screening in response to 2019 nCoV pneumonia.
In 12 hours, GenScript ProBio successfully screened specific antibodies that recognize viral proteins and potentially block binding of virus to cellular receptors. In less than 24 hours, using the Beacon single-cell platform , GenScript ProBio completed immunized mice processing, immune cell isolation and enrichment, single cell sorting, on-chip binding and blocking screening, which usually takes three months using the traditional hybridoma antibody screening. This contributes to the breakthrough in anti-2019 nCoV antibody screening. GenScript is China's first CDMO company that applies the world's leading digital Beacon Platform in antibody discovery services.
In fact, as early as January 23 before the rapid outbreak, Discovery Department Head of GenScript ProBio, initiated the collaboration for an emergency screening project against 2019 nCoV together with Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. The project team discussed the protocol details from antigen immunization to anti-2019 nCoV antibody characterization. For such emergency antibody drug project, the core lies in rapid antibody generation. This involves seamless integration of screening, sequencing and vector synthesis and further development to fight the 2019 nCoV outbreak. We finally worked out the optimal solution of rapid immunization coupled with GenScript ProBio Beacon single-cell platform screening and had multiple alternatives.
Dr. Brian Min , CEO of GenScript ProBio, said: ""Our mission is to accelerate drug development through innovation and collaboration. I am confident that we will defeat the virus by working diligently together with our customers.""
After successful antibody sequence screening, the team will work on expression of those antibody genes, and will perform further virus blocking and neutralization tests for the expressed antibodies. These Emergency antibodies after validation are expected to be put into mass production in GenScript ProBio to fight 2019 nCoV.
About GenScript ProBio:
GenScript ProBio is the CDMO segment of the world's leading biotech company GenScript, providing a one-stop biological drug research and development platform. GenScript ProBio's one-stop antibody drug development solutions include antibody drug discovery (hybridoma, phage display, full human and bispecific antibodies technologies), antibody engineering (antibody humanization, evaluation and optimization of drug compounds and affinity maturation) and other services.

In the media this flu-like virus is called Corona , but actually is labelled 2019-nCov. As Corona is a family name of a virus. The medical world does not know yet much about this virus except that it can be transmitted from human to human, it has an incubation time of 14 days and that you can die from it. The latter said, you can also die from any ordinary flu-virus. But currently there are worldwide at 7 February 2020 more as 31.000 people confirmed to have the virus and 637 people died of the virus. But mostly (97%) in China. But the numbers are growing daily. Outside China there have been confirmed people with the virus in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, USA, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, UK, Russia, Belgium, Finland, Spain, Sweden and UAE. And I am sure this list will grow in the coming weeks and months. For more information see : WHO Emergencies . So should we worry? My personal advice is, Yes! So should be panic? Again my personal advice, No! We should take all measures we can to prevent spreading and getting the virus. But it is like a flu-virus, if we would monitor a new ordinary flu-virus we would probably see that within a few months it is spreading all over the world also. But worldwide traveling has become so easy and so popular. And for many countries it has become an important source of income. So the advice not to travel will not be given lightly. So what I personally do? I minimise traveling and staying at place with crowds of people. And at big public places like a supermarket I will be wearing a face-mask (although that probably only protect others not yourself). Do I trust any government in handling this criss correct?

735,735,"World is becoming a global village. It has its benefits resulting in the form of spillover of technology and skill sets. There are demerits too. One such incidence is outbreak of Coronavirus. Its originated for a busy hub in China. The fear is that actual outbreak is underreported by China. The other angle is that its impact is hyped by west to undermine China's growing economic supremacy.
The economic impact is hard to asses. Nothing with certainty can be said at this point of time. China is the second biggest economy of the world and is an integral part of global value chains (GVCs). Including the neighboring countries like Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Singapore and all in the equation, world biggest manufacturing hub is under question.
China is taking it seriously. Some reports say that around 35 million people are locked down. There are restrictions in air travel and tourism hubs are closed. Stock markets fell from Asia to Europe to North America. The commodity markets are plummeting too. Oil fell to 3-month low. Energy analyst fear that oil prices are likely to remain low for months due to fast spreading epidemic.
Travel restrictions are likely to continue. China has virtually closed Wuhan  known as Chicago of China. City population is of 11 million and it's an industrial hub. Its economic size is $224 billion (1.6% of China) and 319 million tourists visited Wuhan in 2019. The direct economic impact is slowing down China and the spillover is across the globe.
Analysts are drawing parallels to SARS outbreak. The economic loss in 2002-03 due to SARS is estimated at $400 billion in 2003. The world recovered soon in 2004. In that outbreak more than 800 people died in 17 countries and over 8,000 were infected. The recorded number is relatively small in Coronavirus at this point, but its growing.
China has become more global since SARS outbreak. Air travel increased from 56 million in 2001 to over 600 million in 2018. This is not only increasing threat of disease spread but also have higher dent on demand due to travel restrictions.
The human misery is impacting all. The economic implication could be beneficial for Pakistan. Benefit of low oil prices is of no brainer for an oil importing country. This will help in lowering the current account deficit and in creating balance of payment cushion. Low oil prices bode well for the inflation outlook. If the outbreak continues, trade between US and China may be affected more. This provides an opportunity for Pakistan to capture exporting share. ",TRUE,FAKE

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the global shipping body representing 80% of the worlds merchant fleet, is advising its membership to take steps that limit the spread of the novel Corona Virus (2019-nCov).
Reflects advice from World Health Organisation (WHO)
The instructions reflect advice given from the World Health Organisation (WHO), who stated that if certain measures are taken, there should be no unnecessary restrictions of international traffic, meaning ports and global shipping can continue to operate. Industry prioritise health of crew and members
Guy Platten, the Secretary General of ICS commented:
The shipping industry will always prioritise the health of our crew and members of the public above all else. We have recommended that all our members across the world follow the WHO measures. As an industry, we fully understand the importance of playing our role in halting the spread of viruses.
By implementing the measures in their entirety, we are avoiding the needless closure of any port. Shipping can continue to be the conduit for 90% of world trade, ensuring the steady supply of medicine, food and fuel for consumers worldwide. We are thankful that the WHO has avoided a knee jerk reaction, which would do nobody any favours.
Advice provided to shipowners highlights the need for: Exit screening at ports in the affected areas to detect symptomatic travellers and prevent the exportation of the disease. This includes checking for signs and symptoms and keeping confirmed cases under isolation and treatment. Implementing health information campaigns to raise awareness on how to receive assistance if someone is showing symptoms. Collaborating with public health authorities for case management on board ships, should a traveller with symptoms be detected. ICS in safeguarding public health
The ICS takes its responsibilities on safeguarding public health extremely seriously. It has shared WHO guidelines to its members on how best to reduce the possibility of the spread of 2019-nCov.
Results of following the guidelines
The trade body has urged all members to fully adopt the guidelines. Doing so avoids the unnecessary closure of ports, that facilitate 90% of global trade, including the transportation of medicines that underpin the health industry, as well as food and fuel supplies.
Should the WHO recommendations change with the closure of specific ports for medical reasons, we would recommend that the port in question and shipowners follow this advice. ICS will continue to keep a close watch on the situation and will notify its members of developments.",TRUE,FAKE

The first case of coronavirus, a group of viruses that includes some that can cause the common cold and others that have evolved into severe illnesses like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), was reported in December. The illness apparently began in a food market in Wuhan, China, a central city in the country.

With fears increasing, face masks began selling out in China and have begun to do the same in the U.S., which has confirmed cases of the virus. But their effectiveness in preventing the spread of the virus is dependent on certain factors.
Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville told the Associated Press that all viruses are small enough that they can penetrate a typical medical mask. However, he said germs dont usually spread through the air at once; they spread through droplets from coughing or sneezing. He also noted that masks can be of some value as they block large droplets from a sneeze or cough.

767,767,"The Department of Education (DepEd) on Friday confirmed that the scheduled early registration for school year (SY) 2020-2021 will take place amid the novel coronavirus (nCoV) threat.
Department of Education (MANILA BULLETIN)
Undersecretary for Planning and Field Operations Jesus Mateo told the Manila Bulletin that the scheduled early registration will push through as planned, although, he added, We have to take precautionary measures.
Early registration is an annual activity led by DepEd to ensure that all new entrants for kindergarten and Grades 1, 7, and 11 in public and private elementary and secondary schools nationwide are listed months before the opening of the new school year.
DepEd is set to open its early registration desks on Feb. 1, Saturday to March 6, Friday. The activity was originally scheduled for Jan. 25 to Feb. 28, but this was moved to the current dates because Jan. 25 was the Lunar New Year, a public non-working holiday.
In his Jan. 24 memorandum, DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Alain Del Pascua alerted all regional directors, schools division superintendents, principals or school heads, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, learners and all others concerned to take precautionary measures against the possible spread of the virus.
Pascua strictly advised everyone to take precautionary measures such as making hand washing a habit, always covering ones mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with people who show signs of respiratory illness, drinking plenty of water, ensuring food is cooked properly, and consulting a health facility if symptoms of cough and colds persist.
In its latest statement on nCoV, DepEd also expressed readiness to contribute to the overall Philippine government efforts for the management of this public health situation following the first confirmed case of the deadly virus in the country.
Eligibility and requirements
DepEd said for kindergarten, only those who are five years old on or before Aug. 31, 2020 are eligible; for Grade 1, participants should have completed kinder or passed the Philippine Education Placement Test (PEPT) Passer for kinder level; those six years old or older by Aug. 31, 2020 but not kinder completers, who are assessed Grade 1-ready as per ECD checklist, may also pre-register.
For Grade 7, they must be Grade 6 completers or PEPT Passers for Grade 6, or Alternative Learning System Accreditation and Equivalency (ALS-A&E) elementary passers; and for Grade 11, those who will pre-register must be Grade 10 completers or PEPT Passers for Grade 10 or ALS-A&E secondary passers.
For kindergarten and Grade 1, a Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) or National Statistics Authority (NSO) birth certificate must be submitted. In case of its absence, a Local Civil Registrar (LCR) birth certificate, baptismal, or barangay certificate can be submitted.
Learners must also accomplish the Basic Education Enrolment Form during early registration, DepEd said. The early registration policy, DepEd noted, upholds the right of all school-aged learners to enroll and be equally provided with quality, accessible, relevant, and liberating basic education.
Meanwhile, DepEd said that the schedule of the early registration in Taal Volcano-affected areas will be flexible. Earlier, DepEd Region IV-A Wilfredo Cabral requested for the extension date of the early registration to accommodate and account [for] all those displaced by the eruption.
DepEd has also directed that the documentary requirements in these affected schools be waived subject for submission once available.
The latest DepEd data showed that 548,672 learners in 1,010 affected schools under four divisions in Region IV-A are affected by the suspension of classes at all levels since Jan. 13. DepEd noted that 10, 791 learners are currently staying in 224 schools which serve as evacuation centers. A total of 19, 714 DepEd personnel remain affected by Taals unrest to date.",TRUE,FAKE
768,768,"The latest news coming out is mixed. The live map and latest count of 2019-nCoV shows 20,000 confirmed infections, 426 deaths, and most importantly, a spread to 28 countries. Its slightly encouraging that there are no extra cases in Australia and good to hear 3 of the 12 have been sent home, declared recovered . However the incubation period since flights were closed is still only halfway to the average (of 5  6 days) so its too early to tell.
A South Korean has tested positive after visiting Thailand (not a good sign, but the statement didnt rule out China). Japan has quarantined a whole cruise ship (like Italy did). One passenger came down with the virus in Hong Kong. The whole ship of 3700 is confined to rooms , awaiting test results. Its reassuring that so many tests can be done. (Yay, Japan). Meanwhile door handles can carry the virus. Soap and hand sanitizer could help a lot.
On the plus side, one team in Thailand say they have treated one patient successfully with anti-virals. Its only one case, but a nice thought. How big are those stockpiles? The other plus, is that summer may slow it down. Best case is this might be like a new flu. We just dont know. Statistics Feb 4th, 2020 Click to enlarge.
Worryingly there are reports of thirty year olds coming down with the severe form. Though again, this happens even with the normal flu. Another downer is that the latest Ro estimate appears to be around 4.0 much higher than the Flu. Meaning it may spread even faster. Though Im skeptical as thats calculated from Wuhan data, which is both uncertain and there is always the possibility that the Ro may be lower in different countries. For comparison the Flu causes around 300,000 to 600,000 deaths every year. The fear here, justifiably, is the death rate might be quite a lot higher. The next few weeks are very important.
There are no recorded cases in Africa yet, though that seems hard to believe given the large Chinese workforce. Its still possible perhaps for the rich western nations to curb the spread domestically, but if this spreads to Africa, India (3 cases) etc, and possibly to animal populations too, its difficult to imagine how it will not become endemic. Most African airlines have stopped flights to China, though not Ethiopia (perhaps something to do with the Belt and Road debt trap and the man running the WHO?).
If Coronavirus takes hold in other nations, then flights to those, and not just China will need to be stopped to contain it. At that point the question becomes is it worth it which depends of course on the death and incapacitation rate  something we still really have no idea of. There are reports from China both of people who just got the flu and recovered, suggesting that for most people and the young and healthy, it isnt a major threat. But there are also reports of quick and unrecorded cremations, and we know the Communist party has been suppressing the bad news. Photos on twitter imply the army is being brought in. This virus appears to cause the full spectrum from asymptomatic to needing ICU. - -Wuhan Coronavirus Looks Increasingly Like a Pandemic, Experts Say  NY Times The prospect is daunting. A pandemic  an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found. Its very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. But will it be catastrophic? I dont know. Stopping the spread
For those wondering how the SARS and other potential pandemics were stopped  it takes laborious tracking of contacts, which is difficult with symptomless transmission . The response team must isolate high risk contacts, and sometimes even treat them with anti-virals or vaccinations (if we only had one) pre-emptively. Health workers need to wear Hazmat suits and also get the pre-emptive options. We have to ring fence every single outbreak  something we can do when there are very few cases, but quickly becomes impossible if enough infectious people walk through shopping malls and schools.
In this case, if the virus doesnt cause a severe illness in all people, it will likely spread further and faster, as asymptomatic people dont need to report to hospitals or even doctors, and may not realize they are spreading it. Only mass testing around a small caseload would solve that. On the other hand, if there is a significant pool of people who didnt get sick, if we can figure out why, it may give us another treatment tool. And once many have recovered, there may be potential for antibodies against corona virus to be gathered. In the case of Ebola, th e antibodies from recovered people seemed to be the only useful medicine at one point in the battle. New hospital built in ten days: (*Works in Chrome, but not in Firefox)

783,783,"On Monday, China's central bank sent a powerful message about its intent to support the economy, with a larger-than-expected injection of $173.8 billion of liquidity into markets and a deep 10-basis-point cut to its regular reverse repos. By Ni Tao, People's Daily app As of Sunday, the overall number of confirmed cases of nCov-2019 infections on the Chinese mainland reached 17,205, and a total of 361 people had died of the disease. Amid the epidemics outbreak, Chinas stocks plunged more than 8 percent at market open as trade resumed on Monday after the Spring Festival holiday. Experts believe there are many irrational factors behind the pessimism, including panic caused by the ""herding effect."" Across the globe, this sentiment has also been reflected in some medias reports, suggesting concerns that the economic impact on China could be severe. However, as the fundamentals of China's long-term and high-quality economic growth have not changed, several investment banks including Swiss UBS have also indicted the epidemics economic impact will be temporary. Why will the impact be temporary and limited? First, the epidemics impact is mainly inflicted on the first quarter, during which the Chinese Lunar New Year is celebrated. Usually, the proportion of Q1s economic growth in the whole year is relatively lower than other quarters. Though it is imprudent to judge the economic impact of the epidemic by historical experience, some analysts have compared the nCov-2019 outbreak with the 2003 SARS epidemic and made economic loss projections on this basis, with the presumption that the economic blow this time will be much bigger. Its true that the SARS resulted in a sharp decline in China's GDP growth in the second quarter of 2003, but the negative impact was largely offset by higher growth in the following two quarters, and the annual growth rate was about 10 percent. Its also important to notice that todays Chinese economy is not what it was 17 years ago. It is much bigger, healthier and more balanced in structure. China's current economic strength, resources and ability to deal with emergencies have all been significantly strengthened since that time. Second, economic activities after the epidemic will much likely be stronger than normal, to a certain extent, to make up for the gap left by the economy during the epidemic. The epidemic will surely put a damper on the services sector, especially such consumer industries as tourism, catering, entertainment and logistics. It will also harm the manufacturing sector in the mobile phone, automobile, and electronic industries, as well as the trade sector. On the other hand, the epidemic will not completely eliminate economic activities, but instead largely bring about a postponement of economic activities. For instance, if you don't travel during the Spring Festival, it doesn't mean you won't travel, but you're likely to reschedule at a later time. Once the epidemic disappears, consumption of goods and services that can be delayed will rebound. A report released Saturday by the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies noted even in the short term, the epidemic has not caused a negative effect on all the sectors but has benefited industries such as electronic commerce and online games and entertainment. From the supply-side, the short-term impact is reflected in a pause of some production activities. Once the epidemic subsides, production will resume, with above-normal efficiency and speed. Third, China has adopted a series of robust macro polices to support the economy and boost confidence. In an epidemic, small and micro enterprises, because of their small scale and weak anti-risk ability, may face difficulties. Among them, the continuity of the capital chain is the biggest risk. On Monday, China's central bank sent a powerful message about its intent to support the economy, with a larger-than-expected injection of $173.8 billion of liquidity into markets and a deep 10-basis-point cut to its regular reverse repos. This open market operation will drive the overall interest rate down, which is conducive to reducing the cost of capital, easing the financial pressure on enterprises, and supporting the real economy, especially small and micro enterprises. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has also been utilized. As of Monday, Chinas Ministry of Finance has earmarked a total of about $769.8 million to support local governments across the country to prevent and control the epidemic. On Sunday, the city of Suzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province, announced measures including financial support and tax cuts to help affected small- and medium-sized firms. Many other cities in China have also offered similar favorable policies. At the moment, the most urgent task for China is to put the epidemic under control, which will bring confidence and vitality into the Chinese economy. In its latest economic forecast in January, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised upward Chinas 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) prediction to 6.0 percent from the previous 5.8 percent. Gerry Rice, director of the IMF's communications department, believes that China is a large economy with the resources and the resolve to effectively meet the challenge of the nCov-2019 outbreak.

Stanford University is restricting all travel to China. Requests for exceptions need to be fielded by a Vice President, Provost, or Dean and then forwarded to the Provosts Office.
There are many current challenges with travel to and from China. There are a number of current and predicted flight cancellations by major carriers. Currently China is conducting port-of-exit screening, so people exhibiting symptoms are not allowed to leave the country and may be placed in quarantine.
Travelers from China may be subject to enhanced screening measures when entering other countries through airports and seaports leading to delays and potential quarantine for those with illness. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and other U.S. airports continue to screen passengers arriving from China for symptoms associated with 2019-nCoV. I have just returned from travel to China. Can I return to work/study on campus?
For all Stanford community members: if you have returned from travel to mainland China in the last 14 days, we ask that you self-isolate, working or studying from home until 14 days have passed since your return date. This includes all individuals, including children, with or without symptoms.
If you are an employee, please notify your supervisor and then call the Stanford University Occupational Health Center for an initial phone consultation appointment with a physician. If you are a student, please contact Vaden Health Center for a phone consultation. The date of return to work and/or class will be determined after this medical review.

790,790,"For the third time in less than 20 years, a deadly virus previously unknown to science but from the family of the otherwise relatively-harmless coronaviruses has jumped from an animal into humans, fuelling fears of a global pandemic. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) had by last Friday caused illness in 830 and killed 25 people in multiple Chinese provinces and been ferried by travellers into six countries only weeks since its emergence in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Virologists say it is still too early to predict the spread or impact of nCoV but are hoping that lessons drawn from the two earlier, deadly coronavirus outbreaks as well as advances in research will enable faster countermeasures. Scientists discovered coronaviruses in the 1960s and human coronaviruses with the nametags, 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are found worldwide. They account for 10 to 30 per cent of upper respiratory infections or common colds, relatively benign diseases. Things changed early in the 21st century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in Chinas Guangdong province had in 2002 and spread to 26 countries, causing illness in 8,098 people and killing 774 before surveillance and quarantine measures stamped it out by mid-2003. In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) flared up in Saudi Arabia and had by December 2019 caused illness in 2,499 people and killed 861. Although 27 countries have reported MERS-CoV, the vast majority of cases have been confined to Saudi Arabia. Virologists believe bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and both viruses likely slipped into humans through intermediate hosts  civet cats in the case of SARS-CoV and camels in the case of MERS-CoV. The source of nCoV remains unknown, although some Chinese researchers have proposed snakes. Students line up to sanitise their hands to avoid the contact of coronavirus before their morning classes at a high school in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on Tuesday. (AP) Preliminary investigations of the nCoV outbreak in China suggest that the mortality rate associated with it is 4 per cent, which is less than the 10 per cent mortality that had been observed with SARS-CoV and the 36 per cent mortality rate documented for MERS-CoV. However, scientists caution that the mortality rate for nCoV may need to be revised. It is hard to understand the mortality rate with this new virus, currently, as we are only detecting severe cases in the initial states of the outbreak, said Lilli Ren, a scientist at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in China. On Friday last, Ren and fellow researchers published in the journal, The Lancet, their preliminary findings based on clinical records, laboratory results and epidemiological data of 41 patients confirmed with nCoV infection admitted in a Wuhan hospital between December 16, 2019 and January 2, 2020. They found 27 (66 per cent) of the 41 patients had visited a seafood market in Wuhan. All patients had pneumonia and 40 (98 per cent) had fever while a significant number of patients also had cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. The study revealed a similarity with SARS: the majority of patients were healthy people with less than one-third having underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure or cardiovascular diseases. The impact of nCoV will depend on how efficiently the virus spreads from person to person and its mortality rate, said Govindkarnavar Arunkumar, a senior virologist at the Manipal Institute of Virology who had been involved in investigating the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala. Preliminary estimates suggest that nCoV has a reproduction number that ranges between 1.4 and 2.5  implying that 10 patients are likely to transmit the virus to 14 to 25 patients. Experts believe a decision by the World Health Organisation in 2017 to label SARS and MERS as priority pathogens in an effort to stimulate research and development on countermeasures against CoVs is likely to accelerate research to develop treatment or vaccine against nCoV. Biomedical researchers are initiating countermeasures for nCoV using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as prototypes, Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and his co-authors wrote in a commentary published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. For instance, broad-spectrum antivirals such as remdesivir and lopinavir and interferon beta that have shown promise against MERS-CoV are being assessed against nCoV. The route towards a vaccine is also likely to be faster, Fauci and co-authors wrote. When SARS emerged in 2002, researchers moved from obtaining the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV to the first clinical trial of a vaccine in 20 months. Since then, the timeline has shrunk to less than four months. For nCoV, scientists hope to move even faster with new technology, the researchers said. But for now, medical experts assert that the best strategies to prevent the spread of nCoV is through standard public health measures  surveillance, quarantine, the use of personal protection equipment in healthcare settings, hand hygiene and the respiratory etiquette recommended to minimise the risk of picking up any acute respiratory infection.

In the wake of the outbreak, several international airports across the continent introduced screenings and Mauritius introduced a mandatory quarantine on all passengers that have visited Chinas Hubei province, where the outbreak originated, irrespective of their nationality.
The virus has so far claimed at least 910 lives worldwide.
At the beginning of last week there were only two laboratories in Africa that were able to test samples of the killer virus - in Senegal and South Africa.
But by the end of the week, laboratories were set up in Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

809,809,"While bats may be the original hosts of the novel Chinese coronavirus, an animal sold at a seafood market in Wuhan may be spreading the deadly virus to humans, a study published in The Lancet journal suggests.
The analysis of 10 gene sequences of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from nine patients in the central Chinese city of Wuhan found that the virus is most closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.
The researchers, including those from the Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in China, said that their analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of the virus.
However, an animal sold at the Huanan seafood market might represent an intermediate host that enables the emergence of the virus in humans, they said.
For this reason, the researchers noted, future evolution, adaptation and spread of this virus require urgent investigation.
Cell and secretion samples were taken from the lungs of the patients who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause.
The harvested samples of the 2019-nCoV virus were then analysed to determine the origin of the virus, and how it enters human cells.
Eight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood market. One patient had never visited the market but had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness.
The researchers found 2019-nCoV in all 10 genetic samples taken from the patients  including eight complete genomes, and two partial genomes.
The genetic sequences of the samples were nearly identical, which indicates a very recent emergence of the virus into humans, according to the researchers.
""It is striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV described here from different patients were almost identical,"" said one of lead authors, Weifeng Shi, from Shandong First Medical University, and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences.
""This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period, and was detected relatively rapidly,"" Shi said.
As the virus transmits to more individuals, the researchers said, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.
Comparing the 2019-nCoV genetic sequence with a library of viruses, they found that the most closely related viruses were two SARS-like coronaviruses of bat origin, which shared 88 per cent of the genetic sequence.
2019-nCoV was more genetically distant to the human SARS virus  which shared about 79 per cent of the genetic sequence  and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, which shared about 50 per cent of the genetic sequence.
Analysing how the virus binds, and then enters the human cells, the researchers found that 2019-nCoV and human SARS virus have similar structures, despite some small differences.
The researchers suggest that 2019-nCoV might use the same molecular doorway to enter the cells as SARS but noted that this will require confirmation.
Based on the data, they said, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and transmitted to humans via a currently unknown wild animal sold at the Huanan seafood market.
They said that it is more likely that bat coronaviruses are mutating than 2019-nCoV  meaning that the virus is unlikely to have emerged due to a chance mutation.
""These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and 2019-nCoV in particular,"" said Professor Guizhen Wu, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
""However, despite the importance of bats, it seems likely that another animal host is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans,"" said Wu.
She explained that the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating.
No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas many non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were, Wu noted.
Also, the similarities in the genetic sequences between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 were less than 90 per cent, meaning these two bat-derived coronaviruses are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV, she said.",FAKE,FAKE

Well, I came across the following report, from the Waking Times website, at www.wakingtimes.com, that is entitled: ""8 Things To Consider Before Panicking About The Coronavirus"" and indeed gives some valid points to show that people should think about before they allow themselves to fall victim to the hysteria and panic about this ""virus"" Here in fact is that article for everyone to see right here, and I have my own thoughts and comments to follow:
8 THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PANICKING ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS January 25, 2020
Phillip Schneider , Staff Writer Waking Times If you read the news, youve likely heard about the deadly coronavirus in China. Youve probably seen videos of sick people and heard about the impending doom that our great nation faces if we dont do something about this grave threat coming from China. But have you ever thought about why were hearing so much about this virus, despite it affecting only a relatively small number of people in another country? Who benefits from a mass media hype around the Coronavirus?
1. This Story is Getting Massive Hype No one can deny the incredible hype that this story is getting. But, why? Nearly every major news outlet is front-paging the news about the virus. NBC warns of the rising death toll, CNN frightens us with diving stocks due to coronavirus fears (the DOW dropped by 0.6% while other stocks like Bowing grew by 1.7%), the Drudge Report sounds the alarm on the spreading outbreak triggering the quarantine of 56 million people, but Chinas state run communist newspaper, the Peoples Daily, reports only 41 total deaths from coronavirus and 34 cured and released, with the total number of confirmed cases to date at 1287 . Yet, every new development is serious front page news. CNBC released an updating map of those affected by the virus. In China, it looks like they are absolutely swamped with illness, however, to say that the true number of cases is minuscule compared with Chinas population of 1.4 billion would be the worlds greatest understatement of the century. Is the media simply reporting justifiably on a virus that could potentially affect millions of people, or do they have ulterior motives? 2. Nobody Knows Where the Virus Came From So, where did the virus come from anyway? Some speculate it originated in snakes , or previously from bats or contact with other animals in an open-air food market in Wuham, but if thats true, is there no connection to the fact that the Chinese government opened up a new biolab in the same city, allegedly tasked with studying the worlds most dangerous pathogens? Even the science journal Nature was concerned with the facility prior to its operation in 2017 . So, did the Chinese government accidentally or intentionally release the virus? Did it end up in bats, then snakes, then humans? Why were they working on studying this virus in the first place, and who benefits from its release?
3. The Media Makes Top Dollar from Your Fear Along with Americas other biggest go-nowhere news story of the week, Trumps impeachment process, the media rakes in huge sums of money from reporting on medical fear stories. Media executives know that people will tune in to watch a deadly virus sweep the globe. The fear that you experience from thinking about the potential for mass quarantine and death, paralyzes and keeps most people locked into consuming more fear-inducing coverage. Hence, more moola for the fat cats at CNN, NBC, etc. Bad news is good for business, and while statistically speaking you should be far more concerned for your safety every time you get into an automobile, nothing gets clicks like fear and panic. 4. Governments Always Seek More Control from Virus Scares What is the logical conclusion for a population of fearful and paralyzed individuals with no experience combatting a new and deadly virus? Giving the authorities more power, of course.. Let the government forcefully inoculate you and your family, allow the medical-industrial complex to take more of your hard-earned money, and watch silently with the fear that standing up for your rights might lead to the destruction of the human race. 5. This Happens Every Few Years and Pushes Important Issues to the Back Page It isnt hard to find examples of medical hysteria in the past, either. Think back to Ebola , the Swine flu, the regular flu , measles, SARS, or even the plague . Every few years, the media ramps up its coverage of a new virus that often harms a very insignificant number of people. The medical establishment calls for more control, governments call for more control, and important stories get vigorously back-paged. As a nation, we end up wasting valuable time on a non-issue that was never going to matter to begin with, the only net-result being a marked increase in fear and stress.
6. The Coronavirus Doesnt Affect You Chances are pretty solid that you wont even meet someone who was affected in any way by the coronavirus. Statistically, it makes no sense to worry about the virus when you likely know someone personally who was or will be affected by poverty, the drug war , junk food -induced diabetes, opiate addiction, cancer, heart-disease, the looming national debt, war, a lack of clean food or water, stress, taxation, unconstitutional no-knock SWAT raids , pollution , depression, etc. Focusing all of your attention on this new fear is illogical when you consider that we live in a world of daily threats and dangers anyhow. And by the way, spoiler alert none of us make it out of here alive. Furthermore, those who are dying from the virus are not actually dying from the virus, but rather from health complications resulting from having the virus and a compromised immune system, like pneumonia. If the national media genuinely wanted you to be safe, they would be running wall-to-wall coverage of how to naturally boost your immune system and get your body into a state of maximum health, but they rarely mention this fact. 7. The Institutions Who Benefit from Coronavirus Hype are Incompetent and Dangerous The institutions, including the CDC, vaccine companies, and media who benefit from coronavirus hype, are incredibly incompetent and dangerous. One might even go so far as to call them diabolical. We all know about the infamous and highly-publicized syphilis experiments that began in the 1930s, and CDC director Dr. Branda Fitzgerald who was forced to resign in early 2018 after she was caught buying shares of Merck, a major vaccine company that the CDC is supposed to oversee. Theres no shortage of medical corruption in the U.S., both historically and contemporarily, if you look hard enough. Already the pharmaceutical industry is  racing to develop a vaccine , which when coupled with government mandates equals insane revenue.
8. Grainy Videos of Dead and Sick-Looking People Are Being Used to Scare You To top it all off, much of the evidence were getting from the media is sketchy at best. Earlier, the Daily Star ran a photograph of two men in lab coats, one of which was lying on the ground. The photo is extremely grainy and out of focus. Meanwhile, what are we supposed to make of it? Theres no context here or proof that the photo is really what they say it is. Yet, it was featured in all caps on the drudge report. DOCTORS COLLAPSE, it says along with a plethora of other headlines.  Experts fear too late for China   Everyone will get infected   Simulation Predicts 65 Million Could Die  Anyone whos been paying attention could have predicted the rise of the coronavirus and know what the outcome will be. Mass hysteria and collective fear will be used to further erode individual liberties and stoke allegiance to the medical industrial complex. By simply being aware, however, that fearing all the news is illogical, while continuing to focus on your health and wellness, you automatically subvert this attempt at mass control.

NTS Notes: Many of Phillip Schneider's arguments presented here have already been covered in the previous articles I posted about this hysteria....And he presents a few more that show that we are absolutely being manipulated by the criminals running our governments/media/pharmaceutical industry to panic and ACCEPT ANY SOLUTIONS THAT THOSE CRIMINALS PRESENT to ""cure"" or ""fix"" this problem!
Yes, the facts are that there is NO need to panic and to not fall for all the hype and hysteria about this ""Corona Virus"" We have seen so many times in the last few decades (H1N1 scare anyone?) that have been used to prey on gullible minds to have them cower in fear and accept the fraud of having poisonous vaccines injected into their bodies that did NOT work at all and actually did more damage than any of the ""diseases"" they were created to fight!
I will say that the criminals running the media and our governments are obviously banking on ""mass hysteria"" generated by their lies about this disease, and I do strongly believe that they are doing it purposely to get gullible and stupid people to conform to their ""solutions"" to this problem.... And sadly there are already so many idiots out there falling for it, and I have personally seen it for myself!
Yes, there are now supposedly ""81"" victims of this ""deadly"" virus as of the time I am filing this report, primarily in and around the Chinese city of Wuhan, but again that number is so minor in comparison to other diseases out there... But the criminals that run our Jew spew media and our crooked governments cannot let a good ""epidemic"" go to waste
I for one will continue to find the real truths about this ""virus"" and have them posted at this blog when available... I will not fall for the hysteria however, because as a man of science and logic, I am seeking facts and truth rather than fiction..

Its well within a local leaders purview, however, to urge, advise, encourage and implore folks to take additional precautions. And Thurmond did so Thursday.
In a new executive order, Thurmond repeated those five words over and over again while laying out what he hopes will be an effective pandemic transition plan for DeKalb County. In addition to asking residents to wear masks in public and continue following other guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thurmonds order encouraged owners and employees of the businesses allowed to start reopening Friday  places like barber shops, nail salons and fitness centers  to take precautions beyond those recommended by the governor.
The CEO said theres no question that Kemps directives supersede any local mandates.
But he does not exempt local leaders from demonstrating leadership, and he does not exempt local leaders from encouraging folks to do the right thing and make good decisions, Thurmond said.

Under Kemps order, businesses that reopen Friday  and places like restaurants and theaters that can do so Monday  must follow a series of guidelines . They include screening workers for fever and respiratory illness; enhancing workplace sanitation; maintaining proper social distancing; and wearing masks and gloves if appropriate.
In his aspirational order, Thurmond urged, advised, encouraged and implored DeKalb County businesses to go a few steps further.
The order asked business owners not only to encourage symptomatic employees to stay home, but to allow workers who have a symptomatic individual in their household to stay home as well. It also asks business owners to consider expanding paid leave policies to alleviate the economic pressure for sick employees to show up at work.
In addition, the order asked businesses to provide employees with as much personal protective equipment as possible; to encourage patrons to wear masks; and to clean and sanitize public restrooms between each use.
Some Georgia leaders were supportive of Kemps decision to try and start reopening the economy, which he announced Monday. Mariettas mayor said he was going to get a haircut and hit the gym as soon as possible.
Many more, though, were skeptical . Leaders from Albany to Augusta said it was too soon  as did President Donald Trump .
Earlier in the week, Thurmond questioned Kemps decision to start loosening virus-related restrictions on certain businesses, saying he was praying it was the right plan but preparing for the potential that it may have been a mistake.
Thursdays executive order was part of those preparations.
In addition to urging business owners and employees to take additional precautions, Thurmond asked DeKalb County houses of worship to continue sticking to remote services.
It also asked for the state to develop and implement a more robust testing and tracing program  and for the governor and others to assist and support a rigorous investigation of COVID-19s disproportionate impact on communities of color. The latter, Thurmond said, should include an analysis of the cause and underlying factors that precipitated the outbreak and steps that must be taken to prevent pandemic infections in the future.
DeKalb County has second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Georgia. About 55% of DeKalb Countys 760,000 residents are black, and recent zip-code level data provided by the DeKalb board of health showed a significant number of coronavirus cases in predominately black areas of the county.

Also, better or worse health care will result in lower or higher mortality rates. This is also a function of the number of those infected  a health care system can be overwhelmed by larger numbers of patients  there are a limited number of ICU beds  consider this real-life example, written by a medical colleague about a recently-averted disaster:
The possible implications of a major sour gas leak from the Mazeppa plant are almost beyond comprehension. I was one of the first people Allan consulted about Mazeppa, and it took courage for him to run with the ball on this subject, as there are potentially angry parties who obviously took a loss by being forced to do the right thing when MacRae rang the bell. It is well documented elsewhere in this package exactly what transpired, but I can elaborate as a medical specialist, and former army officer trained in NBCW (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare) a worst case scenario. Imagine a large leak of gas with the approximately 40% hydrogen sulfide present at Mazeppa, and a wind drifting it into SE Calgary. The gradual buildup of gas in the suburbs would desensitize the nose, and concentrations could then rise without alarming anyone. Tiny fractions of one percent concentration would make whole swaths of the city critically ill with respiratory failure. As it approached anywhere near a tenth of a percent strength fatalities everywhere. And the thousands of critically ill survivors could not be managed in our city with only about a hundred ICU beds. It could be a wartime scenario, with potential casualty tolls like the worst firestorms from WW II bombing of Tokyo or Dresden. It would make the SARS epidemic look like an inconvenience. Im not being melodramatic; this is an entirely plausible worst-case scenario. David A February 3, 2020 at 5:09 pm
Allan, where did you get information on when the dead got infected. ( I see the link now) Many reports out of China say people are dying in line to get in. Many simply went home. Children under 12, now age 18 are not accepted. Test kits are very short, and many deaths are assigned to Viral pemonuia. All the hospitals in Wuton were overwhelmed when there was less then 1000 cases. ( Not likely)

When news of the virus first was announced, the market sustained a quick modest decline. The next day, investors were reassured by official news from China and the World Health Organization that the virus could be contained. Market valuations bounced on optimism that the world economy would see little to no damage in the first quarter of 2020. Yet, there is growing skepticism that the official tolls of the virus are short of reality. Doctors report that at the epicenter of Wuhan that officials are grossly underestimating the number of people infected and dead. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has an epidemic model indicating there will be at least 500,000 infections at the peak in a few weeks far greater than the present 45,000 officially reported.
The reaction, and not statements, of major governments to the epidemic hint that the insider information they have received is far worse and uncertain. U.S. global airlines have canceled flights to China until mid-March and 30 other carriers have suspended flights indefinitely  severely reducing business and tourist activities. The U.S. government has urged U.S. citizens to leave the country, flown embassy staff and families back to the U.S., and elevated the alert status of China to Do Not Travel on par with Syria and North Korea. All of these actions have angered the Chinese government. While protecting U.S. citizens from the illness it adds stress to an already tense trade relationship. To reduce trade tension, China announced a relaxation of import tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods, reducing tariffs by 5 to 10 %. President Xi on a telephone call with President Trump committed to complete all purchases of U.S. goods on target by the end of the year while delaying shipments temporarily. It remains to be seen if uncontrolled events will drive a deeper trade wage between the U.S. and China.
Inside China, chaos in the supply chain operations is creating great uncertainty. Workers are being told to work from home and stay away from factories for at least for another week beyond the Lunar New Year and now well into late-February. Foxconn and Tesla announced plant openings on February 10 th , yet ramping up output is still an issue. It will be a challenge to staff factories as many workers are in quarantined cities and train schedules have been curtailed or canceled. Many factories are dependent on parts from other cities around the country that may have more severe restrictions on transportation and/or workers reporting to work. Thus, even when a plant is open, it is likely to be operating at limited capacity.
On February 7 th , the Federal Reserve announced that while the trade war pause has improved the global economy, it cautioned that the coronavirus posed a new threat to the world economy. The Fed is monitoring the situation. The central bank of China infused CNY 2 trillion in the last four weeks to provide fresh liquidity. The liquidity will help financially stretched Chinese companies survive for a while, but they are unlikely to be able to continue operations unless production and sales return to pre epidemic levels quickly.
Will the Federal Reserve really be able to buffer the supply chain disruption and sales declines in the first quarter of 2020? The Fed already seems overwhelmed, keeping a $1+ trillion yearly federal deficit under control and providing billions in repo financing to banks and hedge funds causing soaring prices in risk assets. While the Fed may be able to assist U.S. corporations with liquidity through a tough stretch of declining sales and supply chain disruptions, it cannot create sales or build products.
Prior to the virus crisis, CEO Confidence was at a ten year low. Then, CEO confidence levels improved a little with the Phase One trade deal driving brighter business prospects for the coming year. Now, a possible black swan epidemic has entered the world economic stage creating extreme levels of sales and operational uncertainty. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, expresses the anxiety many CEOs feel about trade:
 Because that issue (trade) is on the table, then everybody has a question mark around in some part of their business, he said. I mean, were in this strange economic time, we all know that.
Adding to the uncertainty is a deteriorating political environment in China. During the first few weeks of December, local Wuhan officials denounced a doctor that was calling for recognition of the new virus. He later died of the disease, triggering a social media uproar over the circumstances of his treatment. Many Chinese people have posted on social media strident criticisms of the delayed government response. Academics have posted petitions for freedom of speech, laying the blame on government censors for making the virus outbreak worse. The wave of freedom calls is rising as Hong Kong protesters messages seem to be spreading to the mainland. The calls for freedom of speech and democracy are posing a major challenge to President Xi. Food prices skyrocketed by 20 % in January with pork prices rising 116 % adding to consumer concerns. Political observers see this challenge to government policies on par with the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The ensuing massacre of protestors is still in the minds of many mainland people. As seems to be true of many of these events that it is not the crisis itself, but the reaction and ensuing waves of social disorder which drive a major economic impact .

Will U.S. GDP growth really be shaved by just .4 %? If we consider the compounding effect of the epidemic to disrupt both demand and supply, the social chaos in China challenging government authority (i.e., Hong Kong), and a lingering trade war  these factors all make a decline into a recession a real and growing possibility. We hope the epidemic can be contained quickly and lives saved with a return to a more certain world economy. Yet, 1930s historical records show rising world nationalism, trade wars, and the fracturing of the world order does not bode well for a positive outcome. Mohammed A. El-Arian. Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz in a recent Bloomberg opinion warns of a U shaped recession or worse an L :
 I worry that many analysts do not fully appreciate the notable differences between financial and economic sudden stops. Rather than confidently declare a V, economic modelers need more time and evidence to assess the impact on the Chinese economy and the related spillovers  a consideration that is made even more important by two observations. First, the Chinese economy was already in an unusually fragile situation because of the impact of trade tensions with the U.S. Second, it has been navigating a tricky economic development transition that has snared many countries before China in the middle income trap. All this suggests it is too early to treat the economic effects of the coronavirus on China and the global economy as easily containable, temporary and quickly reversible. Instead, analysts and modelers should respect the degree of uncertainty in play, including the inconvenient realization that the possibility of a U or, worse, an L for 2020 is still too high for comfort .

In China the influence of this new virus on domestic sales of fruit and vegetables has been growing every day for more than a month now.
One fruit trader from Sichuan explained the situation as follows: ""We have encountered unmarketable conditions for our products in recent weeks. This is the combined effect of policies for containment and public fear of infection. Many people have decided to stay in their own homes and few people are still willing to go out for shopping. Fruit in particular is not a necessity, so only a small number of people is willing to go out and buy fruit. Some companies resumed operations in the last few days and we also received some orders from supermarkets, but we do not have enough workers, so we find it difficult to keep up with our delivery targets. Offline sales are quite slow, but online sales remain at a regular level. However, because the holidays are extended and many warehouses have not yet resumed operations, many of our orders are still waiting to be processed.""
The corona virus did not just affect sales conditions in the domestic fruit market. The export industry felt the impact as well. Manager Sun works at a frozen fruit and vegetable export company. According to her, ""although most foreign traders can work from home, the physical product processing aspect of business requires people to gather in groups. We expect to resume business on February 9th. Many of the export orders have been delayed.""
A ginger exporter from Shandong stated the following: ""We had planned to ship three containers full of ginger before the 15th of January, but now we are forced to halt our operations. We are unable to deliver our products on time.""
The balance between supply and demand in the international market is disturbed because China is unable to deliver on time. This in turn has a chain effect on overseas markets. One frozen garlic supplier explained the situation: ""In addition to several reasons for delayed delivery, there is also a reduction in the number of overseas orders. The price soared in the last few days. Clients with products are able to make a sizable profit.""
Reports show that the prices of fresh ginger and garlic in the market of Pakistan increased fourfold. Although Russia did not completely prohibit all Chinese fruit and vegetable import, they did severely restrict import from China, which massively reduced the volume of Chinese fruit and vegetables in the Russian market. Still, the few products there are already twice as expensive in comparison with several weeks ago. Many Russian importers are looking for suppliers from other countries to replace Chinese imports.",TRUE,TRUE
867,867,"A study published on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website may serve as a blueprint  or a caution  as restaurants prepare to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The study, which was authored by researchers with the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China, suggests that an air conditioning unit at a restaurant in China may have contributed to as many as eight other people being infected with the coronavirus in January.
On Jan. 24, three families sat at separate tables at a windowless restaurant in Guangzhou, China  a city in the southeast corner of the country. The tables were next to each other  all nine people in the study sat within the same 20-foot span. An air conditioning unit stationed above a table next to a wall was blowing air toward the other two tables, and an exhaust fan on the opposite wall was blowing air back.
The day before, one person at the middle table had traveled about 600 miles from Wuhan  the epicenter of the pandemic  to Guangzhou. Though that person had the coronavirus at the time, they didn't know it because they were still asymptomatic.
Ultimately, all nine people at the three tables contracted the coronavirus. Through contact tracing, researchers determined that the person who had traveled to Wuhan was the only person that could have passed the virus on to the people at the other two tables.
Usually, large aerosol droplets that carry the coronavirus can't travel longer than about three feet  meaning the families at nearby tables should have been safe from contracting the virus. However, the study determined that ""strong airflow from the air conditioner"" may have sent those droplets between tables, infecting the other customers.
Researchers also determined that no one else in the restaurant at the time contracted the virus. That further proved the researchers' theory that the unit was blowing droplets from the infected patient to others sitting near the AC.
Researchers did note some limitations to their study  they noted that they ""did not conduct an experimental study simulating the airborne transmission route"" or conduct swabs of other non-infected patients in other areas of the restaurant.
The study also said it could also not determine if the eight infected patients caught the virus directly from the person who traveled to Wuhan  researchers said it's possible that three of diners caught the virus while caring for a sick family member, who in turn caught it from the traveler.",TRUE,TRUE

City Councilor Franklin Gacal, who authored the resolution, stressed that the declaration of state of calamity was meant to expedite the pro-active stance of the city government to address the spread of NCOV virus in the city.
He said the declaration of state of calamity in the city was contained in the resolution approved by the City Council on Tuesday which seeks a temporary ban on the entry of all foreign nationals who travelled to mainland China.
The local government should undertake prompt action to contain the spread of nCoV in the city, Gacal said.
With the declaration, the city government can now utilize its calamity funds to procure the needed medical supplies to contain the virus.
Gacal said the declaration was an offshoot of the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency.
Assistant city health officer Lalaine Calonzo said the Chinese businessman had travelled to Wuhan, China during the Chinese New Years holiday and returned to the city on January 22.
She said health authorities considered the Chinese who had undergone self quarantine, as a person under monitoring for possible infection of nCoV.
Health personnel are closely monitoring the health condition of the local Chinese trader to determine if there are manifestations of nCoV during the 14-day incubation period that will end on Thursday, February 6.
If there are manifestations of nCoV, then we will isolate the person, Calonzo said.
She said health authorities were able to track down the Chinese businessman, who has been living in the city for about four years, after a concerned citizen provided them with information on the reported travel history of the Chinese to Wuhan last month.
She urged local residents to provide local health authorities with any information regarding the entry of foreigners and locals from mainland China and its special administrative regions.

The first case is from a 38-year-old person that arrived in the country from Wuhan, China last January 21, 2020. 
Here is the full press release from the Department of Health:
The Department of Health (DOH) today confirmed that a 38-year-old female Chinese patient under investigation (PUI) is positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after her laboratory results arrived today from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia. DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary measures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.
The confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January 21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the countrys government hospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.
I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close coordination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of DOHs decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and have activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management, specifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing measures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients, Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.
DOH is also in close coordination with the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) which includes representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Interior and Local Government (DILG), Justice (DOJ), Labor and Employment (DOLE), Tourism (DOT), Transportation (DOTr), and Information and Communications Technology (DICT). The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to discuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.
The Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities from all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance. DOH assured that its health facilities are equipped and prepared to receive and care for PUIs and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.
DOH has recorded a total of twenty-nine (29) PUIs  eighteen (18) in Metro Manila, four (4) in Central Visayas, three (3) in Western Visayas, one (1) in MIMAROPA, one (1) in Eastern Visayas, one (1) in Northern Mindanao, and one (1) in Davao. Twenty-three (23) PUIs are currently admitted and five (5) have been discharged but are still under strict monitoring. DOH also reported one PUI mortality.

1. All previous coronaviruses have transmitted through droplets
2. So, it would be unusual if this new pathogen was different.
3. The new coronavirus is behaving much like SARS
4. Both are zoonotic, started in animals before jumping to humans, and both appear to have started in bats.
5. The pair also transmit from human to human and have a long incubation periodup to 14 days for the Wuhan coronavirus, compared to about two for influenzawhich means that people might be sick and transmitting the disease before symptoms show up.
6. Follow CDC guidance for infectious diseases when youre on an airplane: Washing your hands with regular soap or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after touching any surface especially since theres evidence that coronaviruses last longer on surfaces than other illnesses, around three to 12 hours. Y ou should also avoid touching your face and contact with coughing passengers by whatever means possible.
7. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on a person or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face you can become infected as well. These droplets are not affected by air flowing through a space, but instead fall close to where they originate.
8. The hospitals guidelines for influenza define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer.
9. Respiratory illnesses can also be spread through the surfaces upon which the droplets land, like airplane seats and tray tables.
10. Respiratory viruses can be transmitted through the air in tiny, dry particles known as aerosols. But, its not the major mechanism of transmission. Viruses would rather be moist, and many fades from being infectious if left dry for too long.
11. The WHO defines contact with an infected person as being seated within two rows of one another. But people dont just sit during flights, particularly ones lasting longer than a few hours. They visit the bathroom, stretch their legs, and grab items from the overhead bins. 38 percent of passengers leave their seats once and 24 percent more than once. Another 38 percent of people stay in their seats throughout the entire flight.
12. The passengers are least likely to get up were in window seats: only 43 percent moved around as opposed to 80 percent of people seated on the aisle. Window seat passengers have far fewer close encounters than people in other seats, averaging 12 contacts compared to the 58 and 64 respective contacts for passengers in middle and aisle seats.
13. Choosing a window seat and staying put clearly lowers your likelihood of encountering an infectious disease.
14. Passengers in middle and aisle seatseven those that are within the WHOs two-seat range also have a low probability of getting infected. Because most contact people have on airplanes is relatively short.
15. But if the crew member is infected as they spend much more time walking down the aisle and interacting with passengers, they are more likely to have additionaland longerclose encounters.
16. A sick crew member has a probability of infecting 4.6 passengers; thus it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill. Whats worse, the coronavirus or influenza? The reproduction numberR0 or r naughtsimply refers to the number of additional people that an infected person typically makes sick. Transmissibility rate for the new coronavirus ranging from 2.0 to 3.1 people. Thats higher than influenza1.3 to 1.8but like SARS, which has a basic reproduction number in the 2 to 4 range. So, coronaviruses are slightly more prone to spreading between people. The case-fatality ratioor death-to-case ratiois the number of people killed by disease divided by the number of people who catch it. Seasonal influenza, despite being considered a global scourge, technically kills a relatively small proportion of its cases, with a case-fatality ratio around 0.1 percent. SARS had a case-fatality rate of 10 percent and the rate for the new coronavirus is currently near 3 percent, which is on par with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Unlike with influenza, the entire human population is susceptible to this coronavirus because no one has ever had it beforeand there is no specific treatment like a vaccine.
Public are dependent on infection control, such as washing hands, reducing contact with afflicted individuals and quarantines.

882,882,"First of all whoever is reading this informative article I would like to explain it in easiest language possible not going into high medical vocabulary. I made a Q&A that I usually get to hear from my patients. All my answers have been researched on WHO data and articles.
So what is a corona virus? Answer is simple corona viruses are simply a group of viruses that causes seasonal flu also called common cold. It was discovered in 1960s.
Does it mean all flues are of corona virus? Answer is no, there are 200 other virus strains also causes common cold like rhino virus and influenza virus.
In fact rhino viruses are the most common cause of getting common cold. And presently in India most of the people having flu are because of this infection. This is nothing new it happens every year, this is why its called seasonal flu. Person with weak immunity easily get infected by common cold.
What is this buzz about corona virus in China and other countries? Recently on 31st December 2019 in China there is a state Wuhan where a very new type of corona virus has evolved, its called novel corona virus (2019-nCOV).
How this new virus infected to humans? Answer is not clear yet. Though there are some theories two are by which its spread. First is through snakes as Chinese people eat snakes for food and the virus from the snakes come to human beings. Second is theory of spreading through bats. As people of Wuhan consume bat soup and its also estimated that bats spread this virus to snakes as well. According to me theory of bat is more correct as the bat virus is 96% identical to 2019-nCOV.
How can you differentiate from other virus flu or novel corona virus? Since all viruses of seasonal flues does have familiar symptoms like coughing, wheezing, sneezing, fever, headache, chills, running nose, soreness in throat. The diagnosis is totally depends on the pathological lab testing to recognize what exactly the virus is. Although the incubation period varies from 2-11 days.
How does novel corona virus spread? As I mentioned above this is just like the normal flu, that spreads from the droplet infection of the infected person by coughing, sneezing, touching or contact.
How can we protect ourselves from seasonal flu? We can protect ourselves by staying more at home and lesser go outdoor unnecessary as you dont know the next person sitting to you have any kind of seasonal flu. Take good diet for better immunity. There is no mask for the protection of novel corona virus. But wearing a normal surgical mask doesnt protect you at all from any seasonal flu virus as the cotton pores of that mask are so huge for a virus to enter. Though a specialized advance mask model called N95 respirator is available for patients, so that they cant spread to healthy person. So the best protection is to wash your hands properly specially coming from a public place.
I am having seasonal flu, Can it be that novel corona virus? If youre an Indian who never been to China, HK, Singapore, Thailand etc. or came in contact to citizens of these country. You just dont need to worry about, it is possibly the same old rhino virus for your flu. Just visit your physician and consult it. Till now there are 3 clinical cases of n-COV has been detected in India.
Whoever get novel corona virus will die? A total of 722 people had died from the virus and 34,546 were infected in mainland China and one in HK and Philippines as per the latest 7th Feb 2020 data of Chinas National Health Commission. So by simple math the mortality rate is just 2%. This means if youre infected by novel corona virus you have 98% chances to survive. As per the studies the 2% who died are having poor immunity that may be because of other systemic diseases like already having infections of HIV or HBV, any heart diseases or diabetes.
If its not as effective virus then why people are so scared of it?/ What is the cure? The answer is till right now there is no cure for this virus available in modern medicine. Its just your immunity power that can fight with this.
Dont believe in any kind of fake news that the cure has been found in alternative medicine or some home remedies. Forget the cure there is no preventive vaccine available for you to protect you from novel corona virus yet though its under preparation and scientists are working over it.
If you have any kind of question regarding corona virus, please dont hesitate to write on comments. And please like and share this informative article to everyone.

The death toll worldwide is now at 910.Of those infections, 6500 are severe, according to official data.It comes as a Chinese official confirmed a worrying new fact about the deadly coronavirus; infections are taking place through aerosol transmission.It was previously understood that two main ways the virus transmitted from person to person were: Direct transmission: breathing in air close to an infected patient who sneezes or coughs, and Contact transmission: when a person touches an object tainted with the virus before infecting themselves by touching their mouth, nose or eyes.However, over the weekend, an official in Shanghai confirmed the virus also travelled through aerosol transmission, which means it can float a long distance through the air and cause infection later when it is breathed in.Aerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts, Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau deputy head Zeng Qun said at press briefing on Saturday, the China Daily reports.As such, we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease caused by family gatherings.

892,892,"With Chinese travel restrictions set following the recent corona virus epidemic, concerns have been raised by Australias tourism industry about a potential revenue loss of one billion dollars.
Following the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, the Department of Home Affairs announced in late January that Australia will deny entry to anyone who has left or transited mainland China from 1 February.
Mainland Chinese travellers who managed to reach Australia from 1 February 2020 have had their visas cancelled and have been placed in a detention area for quarantine.The travel advisory to China currently stands at Level 4  Do Not Travel  and includes travel to all of mainland China. Travel operators have already begun to feel the crunch. Simrranjit Siingh of Fortune World Travel
Simrranjit Siingh of the Sydney-based Fortune World Travel told Indian Link, With cancelled operations, passengers who had booked have been affected already. The advisory against travel is until 29 March so until then we will feel the impact for sure.
He added, The travel industry is usually the first to feel an immediate impact by issues such as communicable diseases or terrorism. With China involved, it is even more impactful, given they are a huge market in our industry. The China-US trade wars alone saw IATA projections down 25-30%. In recent weeks, weve seen the Chinese New Year traffic affected. Sudhir Warrier of Australian Cruise Group
Sudhir Warrier, Executive Chairman of the Australian Cruise Group, a major Sydney-based travel business, agrees there are there are significant concerns at this point.
The impact I believe could last upwards of three months, he told Indian Link. In fact I think it has been underplayed for two reasons: one, the travel ban could be extended, and two, no one in China is booking a holiday currently. With this double effect, it will be some time before we regain momentum.
Warriers fleet of cruise boats  including Sydney Showboat, Magistic Cruises and Clearview Glass Boat  take a significant share of the China tourist business.
Travel is down from other countries like Japan and Korea as well, he noted. Theres a level of paranoia. Other destinations within the country such as Cairns that dont see much domestic travellers will be severely impacted.
My other concern is for the huge logistical infrastructure in our industry; the travel buses, the tour guides, the support staff, the supply chains  there will be significant disruption there.
That the coronavirus has come on top of the bushfire crisis has been an added worry for the travel industry.
Simrranjit Siingh observed, With the bushfires, we could influence the consumer by saying you wont be travelling to the interior. But when theres a global health issue, travellers are rightfully wary, no one wants to risk it. To have had such a bad start to the year, the next six months will be difficult.
Luckily, he notes that theres been no change in passengers coming inward from India. As well, the T20 World Cup is round the corner, and there are hopes from there.
The government has announced that the travel ban will be reviewed soon. Extension of the ban is subject to the advice of medical professionals.

893,893,"Fresh evidence is suggesting that the incubation period of the novel coronavirus in China could be longer than previously suggested 14 days, likely reaching up to 24 days in some cases. Experts believed that these extreme cases did not necessarily indicate an extended incubation period or adjustment of China's quarantine policy but admitted that the epidemic situation may evolve with more epidemiologic investigations and deeper understanding of the virus. In one case, a 60-year-old man living in Central China's Henan Province who has had close contact with a confirmed patient on January 25 showed no symptoms for 17 days but tested positive on Sunday, according to China Central Television. A recent article on the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China, conducted by a group of authors including Zhong Nanshan, leading Chinese expert on the virus, revealed that the incubation period of the novel coronavirus varies from 0 to 24 days, which was longer than the previously suggested 14 day period by experts. The study was conducted based on a sample of 1,099 confirmed novel coronavirus pneumonia cases from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces and municipalities in the Chinese mainland. According to the prevention and control plan published by the Chinese National Health Commission, the incubation period of the virus can be as long as 14 days, and those who had close contact with confirmed or suspected novel coronavirus patients should be placed under a 14-day quarantine. Experts said that our understanding and research into the virus and the control of the outbreak was dynamic, so we could not rule out the possibilities of new circumstances in the future. The 14 day limit of the incubation period was based on clinical observation rather than laboratory experiments, thus it may not reflect all situations, Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times. But even if some patients were found to have longer incubation periods, the number of them would be very low, Yang said.Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and one of the authors of the article, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the longest incubation period of 24 days was an extreme in the study, which did not necessarily indicate that the incubation period could be longer than 14 days. The average incubation period is about a week. ""We will not change our current 14-day quarantine policies solely based on this study or some extreme individual cases, instead we may adjust the quarantine period based on fresh epidemiologic investigations,"" Zeng said. As for more patients testing positive for the novel coronavirus after the 14-day quarantine period, Zeng said that it's likely that the travel history and contact history of such patients were incorrect.

Posted on Wednesday, January 22nd, 2020 by Thomas Hughes Share by Email Moderna Inc, Is A Likely Player To Develop Vaccines For Wuhan Virus
Shares of Moderna Inc ( MNRA ) surged more than 6% in premarket trading and may be headed higher. The move is driven by a growing belief it will be a major player in the development of vaccines for Chinas latest viral outbreak. The disease, a form of coronavirus, has already claimed the lives of nine people in China and more deaths are expected.
The first case of the new coronavirus has been found in the U.S. already. The victim, a male traveler from China, was found in Snohomish County, Washington and is now in isolation. Moderna is already working on vaccines for a number of commonly found illnesses so it makes sense they would tackle this one as well. Vaccines in the pipeline include those for CMV, RSV, hMPV, Zika, and H7N9 flu.
Labeled the Wuhan Coronavirus, symptoms for most are similar to a heavy cold or onset of pneumonia. So far, more than 400 cases have been diagnosed in China. The disease is highly contagious which makes it of particular concern this week. The Chinese Lunar New Year celebration will begin this weekend, 100s of millions of people are expected to travel.
The CDC is already screening travelers at airports in California and New York. They will be expanding their screens to airports in Chicago, Atlanta and other airports with traffic coming from Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization will convene a panel soon to discuss making the Wuhan Virus a global health emergency. Along with the risk to world health, world leaders are thinking back to the SARS virus and its impact on the global economy.
Moderna Inc, At The Cutting Edge Of Today's Medicines
Moderna Inc is a clinical-stage biotechnology company . Clinical-stage means its vaccines and pipeline of drugs is ready to be or in the process of being tested on humans. It develops therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, and rare diseases based on messenger RNA.
mRNA therapies are highly-advanced, cutting edge technologies that threaten to upturn the entire drug industry . They use the body as a drug-making machine, the mRNA is the means by which they do it. The mRNA delivers messages directly to cells telling them to produce complex proteins that cost millions to make in a factory.
The hurdle for Moderna, and others in the gene-therapy field, is that introducing the new mRNA into the body triggers an automatic response. The response includes shutting down protein production and effectively blocking any positive effects the mRNA may have. On top of that, there is concern that if the mRNA can be delivered and not trigger a negative response, it may not be able to make enough new proteins to matter.
The CEO Is Bullish, Clinical Trials Advance
Even so, there is a lot of work being done. Moderna has 11 drugs in clinical trials right now and 20 development projects in the pipeline. The company has collaborative deals with top-players like Astrazenaca ( AZN ), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck & Co ( MRK ), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.
Shares of Moderna got a boost a week or so ago after the companys CEO appeared on Mad Money. Bottom line, CEO Stephane Bancel is bullish on Modernas prospects pointing out a-key drug is moving into the Phase III stage of trials. What this means is the company has proven its therapies can work, in this case for CMV (a common cold that can kill infants and elderly), now it has to prove they work better than todays standards.
The Technical Outlook Is Bullish For This Risky Stock
The technical outlook is bullish. Todays move began even before the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus and sets a new high. Sparked by the companies pipeline and outlook, this rally could have legs . The indicators support the breakout and suggest there is room for price action to run. The best targets for resistance are at the $24 and $29 levels, advances of 6% and 30% respectively.
Traders looking to get into this move are cautioned, Moderna is a high-risk growth stock so be extra cautious with position size. Also, price action will probably pull-back to support or consolidate in sideways action before moving higher so there is no need to rush in or chase prices. Patience will pay off. ",FAKE,FAKE

At least 56 people have died from the virus as of January 26, and cases have been confirmed in several countries around the world.
Suspected cases have been reported in the Philippines, but the results have been negative.
The Civil Aeronautics Board, with the approval of the Department of Transportation, has suspended all flights between Wuhan and all points in the Philippines to prevent the possible spread of the virus. Tourists from Wuhan were also prohibited from extending their stay in the country and ordered to go home by January 27.
The Chinese government has also imposed its own travel ban between Wuhan and other cities in China.
Go asked Filipinos to cooperate with the governments efforts
According to a health advisory of the Department of Health, severe cases of coronavirus may result in pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney problems and death. DOH has advised the public to wash their hands frequently, avoid contact with live animals, drink plenty of water and make sure that food being consumed are cooked properly.
DOH also advised the public to avoid those who have cough and colds and to always cover ones mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing to stop the possible spread of viruses. Those with flu-like symptoms are also advised to consult a doctor.

Its links with China have been an important part of the regions development in recent years. As headlines have laid bare the spread of the Wuhan corona virus, global oil prices fell as low as $58.35 a barrel in early trading on 27 January. This steep climb-down, from a high of $68.9 a barrel on 6 January, demonstrates how demand-side considerations in Asia and particularly China  and the threat of a potential pandemic in the region  have risen to the fore.
Coming amid the shutdown of Libyan oil production and a fresh missile attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, the corona virus-linked drop in oil prices illustrates the now perennial under weighting of Middle East risk.
Repeated incidents over the past 12 months have caused only brief spikes in the oil price, with little lasting impact. Despite the geopolitical situation, prices have remained depressed on the back of underlying assumptions about supply and demand conditions. By historic standards, oil prices have stayed low amid the Middle Easts heightened tensions, which have brought the region the closest to open military conflict this side of a decade.
The market response to the health crisis in China is highly reactionary in nature, given that it is not yet clear how deadly the disease will be and what the long-term impacts on the Chinese economy and commodities could be.
Beijings measures to curtail the spread of the virus will undoubtedly impact economic activity and growth in the short-term, but it is far more speculative to make assumptions about the longer-term impacts. What has been made overwhelmingly clear, however, is the degree to which oil prices are being driven by demand-side indicators, and the extent to which effects on the Chinese economy in particular are able to influence oil prices over and above destabilising events in the Middle East.

At present the mortality rate is about 11% (Ebola for example is about 50%). Incubation period unknown, but probably 2-4 days. Unfortunately CORONA appears to be infectious throughout the contamination period of two weeks. This is very bad from a virological-spread point of view.
There are RUMOURS that the virus escaped a lab in China, but this is unconfirmed. It is a virus that originated in animals, however, and crossed the species gap (same as AIDS) which is always bad for humans. Due to the nature of the Chinese Communists Party, it appears that the outbreak in China is in fact far worse than what is being officially reported,  also remember it spreads before symptomization. Some schools eg in Hong Kong and Vietnam have been temporarily shut down, and schools in SE Asia are monitoring the situation.
If this hits SA (which is probable) the best is to avoid public areas and close contact, and wear a mask, which is FAR from perfect, but some form of protection.
Symptoms of SARS In general, SARS begins with a high fever (temperature greater than 100.4F [>38.0C]). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20 percent of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia.
How SARS spreads The main way that SARS seems to spread is by close person-to-person contact. The virus that causes SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplet spread can happen when droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known.
What does close contact mean? In the context of SARS, close contact means having cared for or lived with someone with SARS or having direct contact with respiratory secretions or body fluids of a patient with SARS. Examples of close contact include kissing or hugging, sharing eating or drinking utensils, talking to someone within 3 feet, and touching someone directly. Close contact does not include activities like walking by a person or briefly sitting across a waiting room or office.",TRUE,TRUE

936,936,"With no approved treatments for COVID-19, Stanford Medicine has joined large-scale clinical trials to determine if remdesivir, an experimental anti-viral medication, works.
In early March, when patients with the coronavirus started arriving at Stanford Hospital, a team of infectious disease researchers at the university put their heads together and made a quick decision. Among the potential treatments for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus, their first choice to investigate was the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir. They jumped right in.
Within a week, Stanford Medicine had joined a number of other medical centers around the world in global trials sponsored by Gilead Sciences Inc. , the maker of the drug, which is not yet approved as a treatment for COVID-19. By the end of March, the infectious disease doctors had enrolled 30 participants in two trials - one for severe and the other for moderately ill patients - who were receiving the drug intravenously. In addition, another group of Stanford scientists began enrolling participants in a similar, large-scale clinical trial of remdesivir, this one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.
""We brought this on fast,"" said Aruna Subramanian , MD, clinical professor of infectious disease and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trials at Stanford. ""We got everything together in a week and were ready to roll. This was record time. This type of thing normally takes two to three months to get on board."" Worldwide push
During normal times, a phase 3 clinical trial - the final step in the process of drug approval - typically takes months of planning, after years of research, before its underway. But these arent normal times. With a fast-moving pandemic bearing down and no approved treatments available, researchers are, like everyone else, desperate for answers, and they have ramped up their efforts to find solutions. Remdesivir jumped to the top of the list of potential treatments in part because it was farthest along in the approval process, Subramanian said. By the end of February, as the virus spread in the United States, there were at least five clinical trials of remdesivir underway. China initiated the first two studies in February, followed later that month by the Gilead trials for severe and moderate patients and the NIH trial. By the end of March, Gilead had expanded to 100 testing sites both in the United States and abroad, and the NIH trial had expanded to 60 sites, 50 of those in the United States.
Gilead recently reported that it is expecting to have preliminary data from the study of severe patients by the end of April. The two studies in China, though, were halted due to lack of patients. ""We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,"" said Anthony Fauci , MD, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , in a press release announcing the start of the NIHs remdesivir trial. ""A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients."" That same month, while speaking about the coronavirus, Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization announced, ""Theres only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy, and thats remdesivir."" Why remdesivir
There are multiple reasons for remdesivirs current reputation as a potential treatment for COVID-19, among them the anecdotal stories that have appeared in the media. While the drug is not commercially available, it is being used to treat patients with COVID-19 through a compassionate care program on a case-by-case basis, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. In late January, reports out of Washington State that the first person in the nation diagnosed with COVID-19 had been treated with remdesivir, and recovered, made headlines. But scientists are quick to warn against basing treatment guidelines on anecdotal evidence and reports in the news media.
""We have had patients hospitalized at Stanford who got remdesivir under compassionate care guidelines,"" said Stanley Deresinski , MD, associate chief of the division of infectious diseases at Stanford. ""Some got better. Some got worse. At this point, we just dont know. We hope to have results soon for remdesivir, and by then we should have another trial in the works for the next best thing.""
At Stanford, the team of infectious disease scientists running the Gilead trials say that, like other scientists, they picked remdesivir as their first choice based on promising results from years of lab and animal research. Often referred to as the Ebola drug, remdesivir was also previously tested in a clinical trial for treating that disease. It failed to show that it was effective for Ebola in comparison with two other drugs, but based on the study, its generally known to be safe in humans, said Philip Grant , MD, assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trial.
For years, remdesivir has shown potential in cell cultures and animals infected by other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, said Robert Shafer , MD, professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, whose lab recently created a coronavirus anti-viral research database. ""Remdesivir looks very good in the lab. In cell cultures, its also been more active in fighting the coronavirus than other drugs. Thats why I think its promising. Im looking forward to seeing what the clinical trials show."" The science
A coronavirus infection occurs when the germ enters the bodys airways through the nose, mouth or eyes, then lodges in the cells in the lining of the lungs airways, where it quickly starts to make millions of copies of itself, wreaking havoc on the lungs, Subramanian said.
The virus makes copies of itself by inserting its own genes into the human cells genetic machinery, basically hijacking the replication process of the human cell. Remdesivir, like other anti-virals, is designed to target the system the virus uses to replicate, acting as a cap that prevents the virus from making new copies of itself or infecting other cells. Whether this works in people to reduce symptoms of COVID-19 or shorten the length of the disease is not known yet.
""We need the data, the scientific rigor of doing randomized clinical trials,"" said Robert Harrington , MD, the Arthur L. Bloomfield Professor in Medicine and chair of the department of medicine at Stanford. ""Thats how clinical science and patient care advances. We cant depend on anecdotal stories in order to practice the best clinical medicine. We have to wait for the science."" Other potential treatments
But scientists around the world arent standing still, waiting for the results of remdesivir trials. All kinds of studies are moving ahead at breakneck speed to find the next best treatment or vaccine for the disease.
""A variety of drugs have been suggested,"" Deresinski said. ""Hydroxychloroquine has been known for 50 years to have nonspecific anti-viral properties. But for now, remdesivir is our preferred agent.""
The anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also have made headlines as potential treatments for COVID-19. The drugs are currently used off-label in certain cases to treat the disease. But with only a few anecdotal studies showing benefits, they have not received approval from the FDA for COVID-19. Reports have warned of dangerous side effects that need to be studied before widespread use. Recently, a small study of chloroquine in Brazil was halted for safety reasons due to high doses causing irregular heart rhythms. ""Chloroquine is being used a little bit too widely without proper study,"" Subramanian said, adding that theres also a growing concern that stockpiling and hoarding of the drugs are limiting supplies for people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis who are prescribed the medication. ""We prefer to be data-driven as much as possible.""
The next step for FDA approval of these anti-malarial drugs to treat - or prevent - COVID-19 depends on data-driven evidence from similar large-scale clinical trials, some of which are currently in the planning process. Whether chloroquine is Stanfords next best guess for potential treatment, though, is still up for debate.
""Ours is an adaptive trial, which means that if remdesivir doesnt work, we can quickly move on to testing the next, most promising drug without any gap in time,"" said Neera Ahuja , MD, principal investigator of the NIH-sponsored remdesivir trial at Stanford and chief of the division of hospital medicine. She is working with Kari Nadeau , MD, PhD, professor of medicine and of pediatrics, and others on the trial, which includes participants recruited at Stanford Health Care - ValleyCare.
""Were hopeful about remdesivir, but we are already planning for what the next drug might be,"" Ahuja said. ""We want patients to get any possible treatments that might benefit them as soon as possible.""

After decade of neglect, infectious diseases (IDs) have re-emerged as a field of inquiry in the area of global public health and health security. Gradually, the world has come to realize the threat of emerging IDs. Human history is abundant with stories of epidemic infections. Epidemiologically, IDs tend to follow a cyclical pattern, since they often produce immunity in survivors, and microbes await a new generation of hosts to infect. On the other hand, the disease-causing viruses or microorganisms migrate to geographically distant and immunologically vulnerable inhabitants, producing a pandemic, or regional and global outbreak. The historical relationship between the humanity and IDs is fascinating and noteworthy. IDs plagued civilizations long before the development of territorial states during the European Renaissance. Subsequently, epidemic diseases shaped human history, generally, and military conflict, in particular. During the Peloponnesian Wars, disease demoralized the Athenian people, weakened the army, and undermined the political leadership. Subsequently, more than 2,500 years later, the 1918 influenza epidemic killed 25 million people, including 500,000 Americans. The Spanish flu struck 294,000 allied troops in the fall of 1918.Moreover, the 1918 flu pandemic killed 50-100 million, which is more than the combined total casualties of World War I and II.
Until the early twentieth century, plague, smallpox, influenza, and other scourges decimated human populations around the world. Despite exceptional improvement in pandemic control, IDs remain a major threat to global public health. In 1998, 13.3 of the 53.9 million deaths worldwide, or 25 percent of all death, resulted from IDs. Historically, some major disease outbreaks in China, including the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu, and the 2002/03 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic, have triggered epidemics elsewhere in the world, killed approximately800 people around the world. In total, SARS infected more than 8,000 people in 26 countries. As demonstrated in the SARS epidemic, the new strain of coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which causes a type of pneumonia that has not previously been identified in humans, resulting spillover of disease outbreaks in China and neighboring countries.
The 2019/20 novel coronavirus outbreak, also known as the Chinese pneumonia outbreak or the Wuhan corona virus, is a viral outbreak that was initially identified during mid-December 2019. Chinese authorities identified the new corona virus has resulted approximately500 confirmed cases in 13 provincial-level regions in country, and additional cases being identified in a growing number of countries internationally. On January 21, 2020, the first case in the United States was also announced. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and Nepal. As of January 22, 2020, nine deaths have occurred all in China. Thus, 2019-nCoV may have serious implications on stability, prosperity, and health security at the global level. Factually, we have now entered in a new era characterized by the dreadful consequences of decade of negligence of IDs at the global level. There is a great desire to know what the future of IDs will bring, and also to know how we should behave in the future to minimize the IDs outbreaks and casualties. Now is the high time to realize that we are in darkness than to pretend that we can see the light.",TRUE,TRUE

We are living in a scientific era and science and technology has advanced to a very higher level. Modern Medicine has been very forthcoming in this matter in admitting that they do not have any specific medicines or vaccines against the current nCoV infections. Even here, The AYUSH failed to understand what is implied if it is said that No medicines are available as of now. They failed to acknowledge that, disclaiming is as important as claiming something, especially in situations like this. Also, it looks like AYUSH was indeed trying to proselytize alternative medicine by utilizing such a global emergency.
The question which arises here is: does Homeopathy has any evidence of the action of efficacy of Arsenicum Album 30C in Corona virus infections? Before answering this the AYUSH ministry must answer the following basic questions, which form the basis of any critical evaluation of any type of information meant to be used on a massive scale for the public health.
1. Where did they find the information? Did they hear about it from a colleague or friend? Did they find it through a thorough search of a database? 2. What is the nature of the evidence ? Does it report the findings of a study, is it a review of evidence or is it an opinion piece? 3. How has AYSUH come to this conclusion? How was the research carried out and what methods were used? Did the researcher make a logical argument? 4. Who has produced the research? Is the author an academic, a journalist, a commentator or an organisation? Is there a danger of bias? 5. When was it written? Is this old or new research? 6. Why has it been written? Who funded the research? Is the research aimed at a particular group of people? (Adapted from Aveyard, H., Sharp, P. and Wooliams, M.(2011) A beginners guide to critical thinking and writing in health and social care. 2nd ed. Maidenhead: Open University Press.)
I am sure that the experts in the CCRH are familiar with these procedures as they are the apex RESEARCH body for Homeopathy in India. However, their advisory clearly demonstrates that they have overlooked the basic steps in any research process and jumped into the process of suggesting the so called preventive, conveniently forgetting the fact that Arsenicum Album 30 do not have any published research paper which has a statistical evidence in showing that it has any anti-viral properties.
CCRH in this incident has exhibited a total disregard for public health and safety, a lack of prudence and utter callousness bordering on arrogance. Let us not forget that this is a publicly funded body which is being supported by the tax payers money and such irresponsible behaviour brings forth just one question:
DO WE NEED SUCH AN IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION WHICH DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF RESEARCH? HOW LONG ARE THE TAX PAYERS GOING TO PAY FOR THIS NOT ONLY USELESS BUT ALSO HARMFUL INSTITUTION? That is a question which not only Homeopathy Doctors, but also policy makers should be asking at this juncture.

957,957,"The Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a public-private partnership that was set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The organisation was established in 2017 following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which sparked initiatives to proactively develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent future epidemics. However, developing and manufacturing vaccines is a slow and expensive process with a timeline judged by most to be too long. During a viral / bacterial outbreak, speed becomes very, very important, explains Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of CEPI.
Although it is not known whether the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will become a global pandemic, there have been over 28,000 global cases, with over 550 deaths. Most cases have been contained within China; however, cases continue to spread, with 27 other countries also being affected. The biggest concern is the welfare of individuals living in countries that lack the necessary systems to detect and treat infections. Therefore, public health measures are becoming more stringent and the pressure to develop a vaccine continues to rise.
Its been five weeks since the 2019-nCoV outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, and CEPI has now amplified its forces by teaming with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), one of the biggest vaccine players. GSK is a leader in the development of innovative vaccines and in recent years has developed novel adjuvants, such as the one used in the remarkably efficacious shingles vaccine, Shingrix. This technology aims to stimulate the appropriate innate immunity and subsequent impact on adaptive immune responses to generate stronger, more specific, and longer-lasting immunity against antigens. More importantly, it can streamline the vaccine development process by utilising smaller doses, which supports the overall goal from CEPI and partners to rapidly find a candidate vaccine.
The practical outcomes of adjuvant systems enable a reduction in the quantity of antigen contained in individual vaccine dose, as well as fewer doses being required to achieve immunity; these combined features of dose reduction and antigen sparing can have important implications for improving global vaccine supply. Dr Richard Hatchett mentioned how the antigen sparing effect makes a given supply of vaccine go farther, increasing the number of people who can benefit; that is, in populations where responses to vaccines are typically reduced, such as infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised.
As a result, CEPI is now in collaboration with GSK, CureVac, Inovio, Moderna, and the University of Queensland, which are all aiming to leverage rapid response platforms with the aim of advancing vaccine candidates into clinical testing as soon as possible. ",TRUE,FAKE

965,965,"So, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infectioncorona virus included. I would check that off the list.
First, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.
Most people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.
If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.
For vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)
Also, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.
Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.
As I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Cant Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.
The RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor. ",FAKE,TRUE

Xinchang County is located in Zhejiang province, and Zhejiang province is one of the most severe virus hit provinces with already 1006 patients confirmed 2019-nCoV diagnose as of Feb. 6th. At present, it is in a tense period of national epidemic prevention and control. In order to respond to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, Antwork actively contacts with local hospitals, supports epidemic prevention with practical actions, fully cooperates with local governments and medical-related units, and escorts the timely and rapid delivery of medical samples and protection materials through the deployment of its drone transportation network. During the epidemic prevention and control period, Antwork took the initiative to take drone RA3 and tr7s as well as unmanned station RH1 as the technical solution, to do the transportation of medical samples and quarantine materials between Xinchang County Peoples Hospital, Xinchang County disease control center and Dashiju branch of Xinchang County Peoples hospital. In this operation, the air delivery system provided by Antwork is adopted. Its automatic and unmanned operation mode can significantly reduce the contact opportunities between samples and personnel in the transportation process, and improve the delivery speed. At the same time, the Antwork branch company (Aerodeli), which undertakes this operation task, has obtained the worlds first urban drone delivery license issued by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last October. The sample delivery work will be carried out in strict accordance with the certified operation procedures, which can ensure the safety of medical samples in the transportation process. Take off and landing point of disease control center of Xinchang County In the actual transportation process, the flight efficiency of drone has increased by more than 50% compared with the ordinary road transportation, which provides an efficient means of transportation for the epidemic prevention and control. At the same time, with more and more medical staff and ambulance being transferred to the front line, in the case of extreme personnel shortage, the use of drone transportation can also save human and material resources to the greatest extent. In addition, using drone to transport materials can effectively avoid secondary pollution of medical materials. As soon as the news of Wuhan blocking came out on January 23, Antwork immediately contacted the health and disease control departments of various regions, and took the initiative to petition for the technical support of drone air transportation for the front-line medical institutions fighting against the epidemic. After the project of Xinchang peoples hospital is put into operation, Antwork will also actively assist more medical institutions around the nation to deploy air transport services and contribute a technical force to the anti-epidemic!

Based on current information, the infection in Germany followed a close contact with a visitor from China during a stay in Germany (diagnosed with 2019-nCoV after return to China) who had previously been visited by relatives from the Wuhan area. The German authorities are investigating this case and taking the necessary steps to trace and inform any contacts.
At this stage of the on-going outbreak in the Hubei province in China, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. As a consequence, it could be expected to see (limited) local transmission in Europe. A single detected case in Europe does not change the overall picture for Europe, nor does it change the assessment that there is currently a moderate likelihood of importation of cases of 2019-nCoV to the EU/EEA. As more and more cases are reported globally, this also increases the probability of sporadically imported cases to EU/EEA countries.
Based on this, EU/EEA countries should ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around any detected nCoV cases in the EU/EEA, in order to prevent further spread in the community and healthcare settings. Healthcare workers in the EU/EEA need to be aware and vigilant in order to detect possible nCoV cases early and apply appropriate infection control measures when handling patients.
Right now, the focus still should be on the development of the outbreak in China and the related information on the characteristics of the virus.
The source of infection is unknown and could still be active. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed but more information is needed to evaluate the full extent of this mode of transmission and understanding how the virus spreads.

They could rent-out a few Trumphotels, but the A/C would still circulate viralmicrodroplets between rooms.So, basically these people on these ships are S.O.L.and will remain there until the virus has run throughevery succeptable individual. Bet there are specialsquads hidden nearby too - to shoot anyone whotries to slip overboard.Now I *did* see a news blurb today about ""making thebest of it"". On one ship there is a wine-tasting tour groupand one of them got a buddy to deliver a case of finewine to the ship BY DRONE :-) I hope somebody's intelligent enough to disinfect thedrone when it returns to from whence it came. I would recommend incineration - or at least a fewhours under intense UV-C radiation ... but then youcould kiss all the plastic and rubber parts bye-bye.I see they released the people on that one cruise shipin Hong Kong - after only FOUR days. Said none ofthem tested positive ... but the virus can take a weekor 10 days to take hold, and you may NOT test positiveduring the incubation period.So, HK may have more to worry about than the commies.If there is a flare-up, Xi will make sure the whole near-islandis cut off from the world and leave them to die. It seems to me very few people - even those whoare supposed to be *in the know* - have the capacityto see more than one or two steps in front of theirown myopic faces. A lack of foresight, that little mind-trip where youask the question ""What COULD go wrong ?"", isnothing unusual in the human race. We get soinvolved in what we WANT to do that possiblefallout just gets totally ignored.Sometimes that may be a good thing. Otherwisewe would accomplish nothing, merely obsessforever on possible downstream consequences.However when dealing with a biological WMD, youshould ask that question OFTEN. Byker",FAKE,TRUE

The construction steps did not stop for a moment, as workers continued day and night inside the Vulcan Mountain Hospital construction site at night, to complete their mission, as completing the Vulcan Mountain Hospital on schedule would alleviate the hard bed treatment dilemma.
The seventh day in the following report provides 10 important information about the first hospital established to treat people with coronavirus in Wuhan:
1- 10 days is the period for establishing the hospital and completing the mission.
2- The hospital is built on an area of 34 thousand square meters.
3- It accommodates 1000 beds.
4- It contains a passive isolation wing that prevents the virus from spreading through the air.
5- Providing each suite with two beds and a separate bathroom inside.
6- To avoid infection  meals and medications are transported to patients via a transport compartment and disinfected by UV system.
7- 2000 workers participated in building the hospital.
8- 1000 sets of equipment participated in the construction 24 hours.
9- The Chinese Air Force transports 58 tons of supplies to support the hospital.

990,990,"Clover Biopharmaceuticals has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (S-Trimer) subunit vaccine candidate for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus via a mammalian cell expression system.
Additionally, scientists from the Chinese biotech had used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus.
Clover said it is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognised by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine.
Like other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope.
The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.
Upon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis.
Utilising its patented Trimer-Tag technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system.
Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.
The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection, said Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover.
This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.
We remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses. ",FAKE,TRUE

Map data showing the virus outbreak in real time is collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the European Disease Prevention and Control Center, the China Disease Control and Prevention Center, and the China National Health Commission.

Information about the Corona epidemic affecting the world
The Corona Outbreak , which spread from Wuhan, China and gave fear to the whole world , caused the death of 132 people. Lets say that the virus, which has caused concern with the number of cases exceeding 6 thousand, is seen in 13 countries . Despite all efforts, there is currently no cure for the Corona epidemic that continues to spread. Doctors prescribe Coro pain relief and antipyretic drugs to treat symptoms. Doctors say that the room humidifier and hot shower will be good for sore throat and cough. People who get sick need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and sleep as much as possible. It is stated that the symptoms of Corona virus are runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and fever that lasts for several days.",TRUE,TRUE
1039,1039,"Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop if-it-bleeds-it-leads press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silenceuntil panic breaks out.
The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentiallyin the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, 25600, etc.nearly 1 million after only 12 doubling times. Biological threats proliferateuntil they run out of susceptible victims.
In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .
As in1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.
Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.
There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of confirmed caseswhile countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.
The New England Journal of Medicine writes , Another Decade, Another Coronavirus. This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.
This virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effectiveespecially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.
The Peoples Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.
A report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread .
The corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .
In a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masksregular surgical masks are probably of little help.
Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.
Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their familys and their communitys survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own. For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly .

1046,1046,"Japanese drugstores are struggling to meet the growing demand for face masks as the fear of the Chinese corona virus grows.
Face masks are often the first choice for people in Japan if they want to protect themselves from infectious diseases. As reports of the corona virus increase, more and more people in Japan are accessing these masks. Replenishment problems with face masks
However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to buy them because the shelves in the drugstores are increasingly empty and the producers have problems with replenishment. Every day within a few hours of the opening, we no longer have masks, said an employee in a drug store in the Shinjuku district. Its been like this since the corona virus broke out.
Other shops in the area have similar problems. Most of them said that face masks are usually sold out by 10 a.m. and daily deliveries dont arrive on time. Others had to limit the number of masks that each customer can buy to prevent a customer from emptying the entire inventory.
Clever, a manufacturer in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, announced that it has received almost 20 times the number of orders for high quality face masks from domestic and foreign customers. The company, which typically receives 10 orders per day during this time of year, instructed all employees involved in the manufacture of other products to concentrate on the manufacture of the masks. It is still unclear whether the masks will help to fight coronavirus infection
Im sorry, but we cannot keep up with demand, said company president Eri Ishibashi. The particle size of the new corona virus is not yet known, so we cannot even say with certainty that these masks will be effective.
Surgical masks that are sold in drug stores are mostly designed to keep bacteria out. On the other hand, N95 surgical masks are used to prevent virus inhalation and the spread of infectious diseases.
In any case, doctors recommend wearing face masks so that they completely cover the nose and mouth and there is no distance between the mask and skin so that no virus is inhaled. However, the most important thing is to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.",TRUE,FAKE

1055,1055,"The head of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus has declared that the respiratory disease Novel Corona virus is not yet an official Public Health Emergency of International Concern. He, however, warned that the disease is an emergency in China.
The declaration came after two days of deliberations, in which the WHO Emergency Committee remained divided on whether to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
The disease has spread rapidly to several countries including Japan, Singapore and the United States of America, and Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, said in a press conference held in Geneva that the outbreak poses a very high risk in China.
According to the World Health Organisation, 584 cases have now been reported, including 17 deaths. 575 of the reported cases were in China, while the other were in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the United States of America and Vietnam, with further possible cases being investigated in other countries; among them, The United Kingdom.
The WHO chief acknowledged that there are still many unknown factors about the disease.
We dont know the source of this virus. We dont understand how easily it spreads and we dont fully understand its clinical features or severity But we know that among those infected, one-quarter of patients have experienced severe disease and that it can kill. We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, that weakened their immune systems.
The WHO chief warned, that the agencys decision should not be taken as a sign that it is doing nothing adding that the WHO is following the outbreak every minute of every day, at a country, regional and global level, to prevent human to human transmission.
He added that the WHO is working with the partners in China and the other affected countries at the regional level, and at the headquarters in Geneva, to fill the gaps in the knowledge as quickly as possible.
Ghebreyesus says that the health agency has also provided guidance to all countries for the rapid identification, management and containment of the virus based on the sequence from China.
A statement released by WHO soon after the press conference, noted that the Committee members agree on the urgency of the situation, and suggested the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.
All countries, recommends the Committee should be prepared to contain the virus, through active surveillance, early detection, isolation, case management, and prevention of onward spread of infection, and to share full data with WHO.

1062,1062,"The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 in the Peoples Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thursday, 30 January 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committees role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.
Proceedings of the meeting Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference
The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.
Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.
A representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.
Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting.
The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.
Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Peoples Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.
The WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths.
At its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but theCommittee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion.
This second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases.
Conclusions and advice The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools.
The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.
The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners.
The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China.
The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations.
The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that.
Advice to WHO The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.
The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out hidden transmission and to inform risk management measures
The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.
WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally.
WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.
Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed.
WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.
WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).
WHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations.
The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.
The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committees advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.
To the Peoples Republic of China Continue to:
 Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment.
 Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.
 Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce.
 Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China.
 Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it.
 Share relevant data on human cases.
 Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available.
 Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.
To all countries It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website .
Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR.
Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.
Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.
The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.
Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.
The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.
To the global community As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.
Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.
Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.
The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General.
