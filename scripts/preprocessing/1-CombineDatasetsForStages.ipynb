A U.S. missile strike on an airbase near the Syrian city of Homs on Friday caused deaths but is not believed to have resulted in \\\"big human casualties\\\" Homs Governor Talal Barazi said. Barazi said the attack served the interests of \\\"armed terrorist groups\\\" including Islamic State adding that the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra. Barazi was speaking in a series of phone interviews with media on Friday. He confirmed deaths at the airbase in a phone interview with Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen. \\\"I believe - God willing - that the human casualties are not big but there is material damage. We hope there are not many victims and martyrs\\\" he told Reuters by telephone. Speaking at dawn he said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base. He said the attack was a form of \\\"support for the armed terrorist groups and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorism\\\". Speaking to Syrian state TV Barazi said \\\"The Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. \\\"This targeting was not the first and I dont believe it will be the last\\\" he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen he said \\\"The war against terrorism will continue.\\\" U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week declaring he acted in Americas \\\"national security interest\\\" against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. officials said the military fired dozens of cruise missiles against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assads forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. The U.S. strikes \\\"targeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specifically\\\" in order to publicly \\\"serve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long run\\\" Barazi added in his interview with state TV.-REUTERS\",\n          \"29 Syria Rebels Dead in Fighting for Key Aleppo Road. At least 29 Syrian rebels were killed in clashes with regime troops overnight during a failed bid to reopen the oppositions key supply route into Aleppo city a monitor said Sunday. The fighters from the Faylaq al-Sham Islamist faction and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front were killed trying to reopen the Castello Road which regime forces effectively severed on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said.--AFP\",\n          \"Death toll from Aleppo bomb attack at least 112. The death toll from a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo reached at least 112 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers the Civil Defence said that they had carted away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies.

Syrian state television also reported the blast saying four people had been killed and 22 wounded in a \\\"terrorist explosion\\\" at the southern entrance of the city. In the northern province of Raqa two suicide bombers exploded inside base 17 an army base under siege by opposition forces according to the Observatory a Britain-based group that relies on activists and other witnesses inside Syria. The group said two fighters from the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had blown themselves up at the headquarters which is north of the groups stronghold in Raqas provincial capital. Clashes between regime forces and ISIL broke out after the blasts which the Observatory said killed several soldiers. In Damascus meanwhile the group said a man died after regime shelling a day earlier on the Palestinian Yarmuk camp where a ceasefire has broken down. The renewed fighting has halted aid delivery efforts to the besieged camp where two more people died from lack of food and medical care on Wednesday the Observatory said. Around 130 people are reported to have died because of shortages in the camp caused by the tight army siege.  people are estimated to have been killed since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CRIME\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(df_crime['label'].value_counts())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69},"id":"I19YSTYbHxST","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712022705546,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"518a8f8e-21bd-4ca4-ee56-a06e17a48ee2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["0    426\n","1    378\n","Name: label, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_science = pd.read_feather(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTrainingDatasets/climate_dataset.feather\") # science\n","df_science['domain'] = 'SCIENCE'\n","display(df_science.head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"hE5f_-aCAnrW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714001447931,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1027,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"142e65ae-2dc2-42ff-bb75-09517c9a33da"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label  \\\n","0  Global warming is driving polar bears toward e...      0   \n","1  The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could c...      0   \n","2  They tell us that we are the primary forces co...      0   \n","3  The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing the mos...      0   \n","4  Volcanoes Melting West Antarctic Glaciers, Not...      0   \n","\n","                                            metadata   domain  \n","0  [{'article': 'Extinction risk from global warm...

It\\u2019s not just anxiety either; 65% said they feel overwhelmed by coronavirus news, 56% just get plain angry, 67% feel burnt out, 59% experience fearfulness, and 50% can\\u2019t help but feel hopeless after hearing the nightly news.\\n\\nAnd of course Americans are not just watching more news than ever before.  According to Comcast, the average U.S. household has actually been watching 66 hours of TV a week during this pandemic\\u2026\\n\\nNew research from telecomms firm Comcast has revealed viewing time has soared as a result, with households watching an extra eight-plus hours of TV each week \\u2013 equivalent to the time spent on a full days\\u2019 work shift.\\n\\nThis means the average household now watches 66 hours of TV a week, up from 57 hours a week in early March.\\n\\nWatching endless hours of television is one of the worst possible things that you can do for your mental health.\\n\\nIf you put garbage into your mind, you are going to get garbage out.\\n\\nAnd allowing the corporate media elite to endlessly feed hour after hour of \\u201cprogramming\\u201d directly into your mind is incredibly self-destructive.\\n\\nIn addition to binge-watching television, many Americans have also been dealing with this crisis by turning to drugs and alcohol\\u2026\\n\\nFindings by The Recovery Village, a Florida-based network of addiction treatment facilities, reflect an \\u201cexpected\\u201d increase in substance use during the pandemic, with Americans reporting a 55% rise in alcohol consumption in the last month. When it came to illicit drugs, 36% of Americans reported increased use of marijuana and prescription opioids, among others.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this is more self-destructive behavior that is just going to fuel even more anxiety, depression and despair.\\n\\nYes, this pandemic has been bad.  There have been more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States so far, and about 100,000 Americans have died.\\n\\nBut this isn\\u2019t the worst thing that we are going to face.  In fact, it isn\\u2019t even close.\\n\\nSo if we can\\u2019t handle what is happening right now, how in the world are we going to be able to handle what is coming?\\n\\nThe good news is that this pandemic is causing a lot of people to wake up and reflect on what really matters.\\n\\nPrior to COVID-19, a lot of Americans were living for their careers.  But this crisis has demonstrated how rapidly those jobs can disappear.  There is absolutely no loyalty in the corporate world today, and most corporations will not hesitate to lay off workers once they start bleeding money.  At this point, more than 38 million Americans have already lost their jobs, and more job losses are coming in the weeks and months ahead.\\n\\nOther Americans were living for the pleasures of this life before this pandemic came along.  But now bars, clubs and movie theaters all over the country have been shut down, professional sports leagues have been paralyzed, and this virus has even transformed dating into a hazard that many people simply don\\u2019t want to deal with.\\n\\nSo many of the things that we once valued so highly have been taken away, and maybe that is precisely what we needed.  Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan created quite an uproar when he made this point very strongly on Instagram\\u2026\\n\\n\\u201cWord up, can you handle the truth my brother only love HH,\\u201d wrote Hogan, who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram. \\u201cIn three short months, just like He did with the plagues of Egypt, God has taken away everything we worship.\\n\\n\\u201cGod said, \\u2018you want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You want to worship musicians, I will shut down Civic Centers. You want to worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don\\u2019t want to go to church and worship Me, I will make it where you can\\u2019t go to church.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\\u2019t have said it better myself.  I wrote an entire book urging people to start focusing on what really matters, because true hope will not be found in the temporal things that the world is constantly chasing.\\n\\nAnd it has definitely been encouraging to hear that many young people have taken this crisis as an opportunity to start thinking about spiritual issues more\\u2026\\n\\nA majority of teens and young adults say they are praying more or thinking about spiritual issues more than they were prior to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey.\\n\\nThe poll of 800 high school students and 800 post-secondary students found that 67 percent said they\\u2019re either praying more often or thinking about spiritual issues more compared to the time before the virus.\\n\\nThere is hope, but it won\\u2019t be found on a television screen, at the bottom of a bottle or at the end of a needle.\\n\\nSo please don\\u2019t give up.  Despite all of the craziness in our world today, the best chapters of your life can still be ahead of you.\\n\\nBut if you keep feeding your mind endless hours of media \\u201cprogramming\\u201d and you keep chasing the things that they tell you to chase, all that is ahead of you is more pain, more anxiety, more depression and more despair.\",\n          \"The Ministry of Health in Bermuda has confirmed a newspaper report that 10 residents from the Westmeath Residential and Nursing Home had tested positive for COVID-19, taking the island\\u2019s total confirmed cases past the 100 mark.\\nA further 213 of the 1,173 tests that have been carried out, were received from across Bermuda yesterday and today, all of which were negative, the ministry said on Saturday night.\\nThese included 74 essential workers, who received negative results at the new drive-through testing facility at Southside, near the international airport, which remains closed to regular commercial flights.\\nBermuda is under lockdown until May 2, although more businesses are being allowed to reopen on a limited basis.\\nThe island has a total of 109 confirmed cases, of which 65 are active.\\nEleven people are in hospital, 54 are being actively monitored and 39 have recovered.\\nFive people have died.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_health_fn['domain'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Scyu9ePe10IA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712022706809,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"4d0eb838-9a1e-4c25-feca-1d30b39562cf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["HEALTH    3119\n","Name: domain, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_health_fnir = pd.read_feather(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTrainingDatasets/health_fnir_dataset.feather\") # health (2 out of 2)\n","df_health_fnir['metadata'] = df_health_fnir['metadata'].apply(lambda x: [x])\n","df_health_fnir['domain'] = 'HEALTH'\n","display(df_health_fnir.head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"IfOMCvdv0cXZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714001463700,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":822,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"39fbfc04-8236-492f-9b04-10b347ebae07"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label  \\\n","0  Just in: Novel coronavirus named 'Covid-19': U...      0   \n","1  WHO officially names #coronavirus as Covid-19....      0   \n","2  The #UN #health agency announced that \"COVID-1...      0   \n","3  The Indian Embassy in Tokyo has said that one ...      0   \n","4  Ground Zero | How Kerala used its experience i...      0   \n","\n","                                            metadata  domain  \n","0  [{'date': '2/11/20', 'link': 'https://twitter....

Despite all of the craziness in our world today, the best chapters of your life can still be ahead of you.\\n\\nBut if you keep feeding your mind endless hours of media \\u201cprogramming\\u201d and you keep chasing the things that they tell you to chase, all that is ahead of you is more pain, more anxiety, more depression and more despair.\",\n          \"The Ministry of Health in Bermuda has confirmed a newspaper report that 10 residents from the Westmeath Residential and Nursing Home had tested positive for COVID-19, taking the island\\u2019s total confirmed cases past the 100 mark.\\nA further 213 of the 1,173 tests that have been carried out, were received from across Bermuda yesterday and today, all of which were negative, the ministry said on Saturday night.\\nThese included 74 essential workers, who received negative results at the new drive-through testing facility at Southside, near the international airport, which remains closed to regular commercial flights.\\nBermuda is under lockdown until May 2, although more businesses are being allowed to reopen on a limited basis.\\nThe island has a total of 109 confirmed cases, of which 65 are active.\\nEleven people are in hospital, 54 are being actively monitored and 39 have recovered.\\nFive people have died.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_health['domain'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gfh-pizM1225","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712022707334,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"dac77c04-acde-48a7-aa33-61e6f3e3feb7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["HEALTH    10707\n","Name: domain, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_social = pd.read_feather(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTrainingDatasets/social_dataset.feather\") # social\n","df_social['metadata'] = df_social['metadata'].apply(lambda x: [x])\n","df_social['domain'] = 'SOCIAL'\n","display(df_social.head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"G1G3wleD4cC2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714001503275,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1715,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"f90f291c-30ba-45f9-805f-e29195c4646f"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label  \\\n","0  Teen Mom Star Jenelle Evans' Wedding Dress Is ...      0   \n","1  Kylie Jenner refusing to discuss Tyga on Life ...      0   \n","2                                      Quinn Perkins      0   \n","3  I Tried Kim Kardashian's Butt Workout & Am For...      0   \n","4  Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas ...      0   \n","\n","                                            metadata  domain  \n","0  [{'link': 'https://www.brides.com/story/teen-m...

[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them \\u201csnake oil,\\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars.

Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration\\u2019s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. \\u201cThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD\\u2019s study and will continue to defend the president\\u2019s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,\\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: \\u201cAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.\\u201d Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal \\u201cgreat news.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it\\u2019s not good for the military or our country,\\u201d Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama\\u2019s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military \\u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\\u201d Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump\\u2019s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president\\u2019s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants\\u2019 sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept \\u201csome individuals who are not medically fit for service.\\u201d The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump\\u2019s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president\\u2019s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. \",\n          \"SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge \\u201cmuch more\\u201d to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     \\u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\\u2019s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the \\u201cAmazon Washington Post\\u201d fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump\\u2019s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. \\u201cWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,\\u201d he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon\\u2019s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump\\u2019s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its \\u201cproductive relationship\\u201d with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service\\u2019s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\\u2019s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\\u2019s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \\u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\\u201d Graham said on CBS\\u2019s Face the Nation news program. \\u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\\u201d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \\u201cgoing to be fair.\\u201d    Russia\\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\\u2019s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \\u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\\u201d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \\u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\\u201d he said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"POLITICS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_politics_isot['label'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mVEsPh2yT9EK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712022718619,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"8d9ea372-f7fa-441e-a547-c94a0b525589"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1    23481\n","0    21417\n","Name: label, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# df_politics = pd.concat([df_politics_liar, df_politics_fake_news, df_politics_isot], ignore_index=True) # combining politics train set\n","df_politics = pd.concat([df_politics_fake_news, df_politics_isot], ignore_index=True) # combining politics train set [removed liar]\n","\n","display(df_politics.head())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"0_ECiF8PUGRu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714001531663,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":191,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Dumitrescu","userId":"07746678083114399049"}},"outputId":"c89b4ea7-8b24-43d6-9a1d-0fbf9f38bfff"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label  \\\n","0  House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Let...      1   \n","1  Ever get the feeling your life circles the rou...      0   \n","2  Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, ...      1   \n","3  Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstr...      1   \n","4  Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to...      1   \n","\n","                                            metadata    domain  \n","0  [{'author': 'Darrell Lucus', 'title': 'House D...

[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis.

Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere.

(Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them \\u201csnake oil,\\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

A U.S. missile strike on an airbase near the Syrian city of Homs on Friday caused deaths but is not believed to have resulted in \\\"big human casualties\\\" Homs Governor Talal Barazi said. Barazi said the attack served the interests of \\\"armed terrorist groups\\\" including Islamic State adding that the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra. Barazi was speaking in a series of phone interviews with media on Friday. He confirmed deaths at the airbase in a phone interview with Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen. \\\"I believe - God willing - that the human casualties are not big but there is material damage. We hope there are not many victims and martyrs\\\" he told Reuters by telephone. Speaking at dawn he said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base. He said the attack was a form of \\\"support for the armed terrorist groups and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorism\\\". Speaking to Syrian state TV Barazi said \\\"The Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. \\\"This targeting was not the first and I dont believe it will be the last\\\" he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen he said \\\"The war against terrorism will continue.\\\" U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week declaring he acted in Americas \\\"national security interest\\\" against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. U.S. officials said the military fired dozens of cruise missiles against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assads forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. The U.S. strikes \\\"targeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specifically\\\" in order to publicly \\\"serve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long run\\\" Barazi added in his interview with state TV.-REUTERS\",\n          \"29 Syria Rebels Dead in Fighting for Key Aleppo Road.

The fighters from the Faylaq al-Sham Islamist faction and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front were killed trying to reopen the Castello Road which regime forces effectively severed on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said.--AFP\",\n          \"Death toll from Aleppo bomb attack at least 112. The death toll from a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo reached at least 112 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers the Civil Defence said that they had carted away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place.
