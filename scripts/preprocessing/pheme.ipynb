The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race.

The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race. South Africa is staring down the barrel of ratings downgrades after the Treasury last month widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product while lowering this year s economic growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SCIENCE\",\n          \"POLITICS\",\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"POLITICS\",\n          \"CRIME\",\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_testing.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Outputs/Overall_Testing_Dataset_Results/classifier_output_combined_nodups.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"6Hqh4z-tAZeG"},"id":"6Hqh4z-tAZeG","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["og_pt1 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTestingDatasets/testing_all1.csv\")\n","og_pt2 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTestingDatasets/testing_all2.csv\")\n","og_pt3_pheme = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ForTesting/PhemeComplete/pheme.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"7S0s_Hx85sPN"},"id":"7S0s_Hx85sPN","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["og_pt3_pheme.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/CSI4900/Datasets/ProcessedTestingDatasets/politics_pheme.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"-qkXFVfq6BCa"},"id":"-qkXFVfq6BCa","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# og_pt1 = og_pt1.dropna(subset = ['text'])\n","# og_pt2 = og_pt2.dropna(subset = ['text'])\n","# og_pt3_pheme = og_pt3_pheme.dropna(subset = ['text'])"],"metadata":{"id":"ZW6pq4gB6QOE"},"id":"ZW6pq4gB6QOE","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_testing_og = pd.concat([og_pt1, og_pt2, og_pt3_pheme])\n","all_testing_og = all_testing_og.drop_duplicates(subset=['text'])\n","display(all_testing_og)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"q9CBP_H86W-Y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712529489639,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":970,"user":{"displayName":"Svetlana Esina","userId":"00933202399777418469"}},"outputId":"a662ff05-5c49-4a10-e25f-ff75b4401c89"},"id":"q9CBP_H86W-Y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["      Unnamed: 0                                               text  label  \\\n","0              0  Does This Video Show a Thwarted Mothers Day Ro...      0   \n","1              1  Should You Call #77 or 112 to Contact the Poli...      1   \n","3              3  Was a Child Named Chloe Jones Abducted by a Cr...      1   \n","5              5       Colored Stickers Target Homes of Dog Owners?      1   \n","15            15  Crime in Sweden, Part III: Does Sweden Have No...      1   \n","...          ...                                                ...    ...   \n","6419        6419  Sydney siege ends as police storm Lindt Cafe a...      0   \n","6420        6420  Breaking News: #SydneySiege is over, according...      0   \n","6421        6421  Watch gunfire erupt and hostages flee chocolat...      0   \n","6422        6422  Authorities have confirmed that #sydneysiege i...      0   \n","6423        6423  WATCH: The dramatic moment tactical teams stor...      0   \n","\n","                                               metadata    domain       author  \n","0     [{'article_category_phase1': 'Crime', 'article...

The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race. South Africa is staring down the barrel of ratings downgrades after the Treasury last month widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product while lowering this year s economic growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27662,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'author': 'Bill Proctor', 'factcheck_analysis_link': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/feb/23/bill-proctor/rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-/', 'factcheck_date': '2/23/2012', 'factchecker': 'Amy Sherman', 'statement_date': '1/6/2012', 'statement_source': 'news'}]\",\n          \"[{'author': 'Donald Trump Jr.', 'factcheck_analysis_link': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/05/donald-trump-jr/no-wisconsin-voter-turnout-did-not-jump-67-2016-89/', 'factcheck_date': '11/5/2020', 'factchecker': 'Eric Litke', 'statement_date': '11/4/2020', 'statement_source': 'social_media'}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SCIENCE\",\n          \"POLITICS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2889,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"officialroycey\",\n          \"DistressCentreO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_testing['label'] = all_testing_og['label']\n","all_testing"],"metadata":{"id":"SisRmpQM641S","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712529513096,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":826,"user":{"displayName":"Svetlana Esina","userId":"00933202399777418469"}},"outputId":"3412272e-4836-451b-8c86-19db254921fa"},"id":"SisRmpQM641S","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["      Unnamed: 0.1  index  Unnamed: 0    id  \\\n","0              0.0    0.0           0     0   \n","1              1.0    1.0           1     1   \n","3              3.0    3.0           3     3   \n","5              5.0    5.0           5     5   \n","15            15.0   15.0          15    15   \n","...            ...    ...         ...   ...   \n","6419           NaN    NaN        6419  6419   \n","6420           NaN    NaN        6420  6420   \n","6421           NaN    NaN        6421  6421   \n","6422           NaN    NaN        6422  6422   \n","6423           NaN    NaN        6423  6423   \n","\n","                                                   text expected_domain  \\\n","0     Does This Video Show a Thwarted Mothers Day Ro...

The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race. South Africa is staring down the barrel of ratings downgrades after the Treasury last month widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product while lowering this year s economic growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expected_domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SCIENCE\",\n          \"POLITICS\",\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"POLITICS\",\n          \"CRIME\",\n          \"HEALTH\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["all_testing = all_testing.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0.1', 'index', 'Unnamed: 0'])\n","all_testing"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"bkCrqiKyttqR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712529569904,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1139,"user":{"displayName":"Svetlana Esina","userId":"00933202399777418469"}},"outputId":"a47ee2b8-ed85-4788-ec24-d4e140f6dd48"},"id":"bkCrqiKyttqR","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        id                                               text expected_domain  \\\n","0        0  Does This Video Show a Thwarted Mothers Day Ro...

The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race.

High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein s remarks on systemic violence in the country, saying they reflected  flawed logic , state news agency MENA reported. Ambassador Amr Ramadan was quoted as saying that he had cautioned Zeid against his office becoming a  mouthpiece for paid agencies with political and economic agendas,  and he rejected his accusations, without elaborating. At a UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva on Monday, Hussein said the state of emergency declared by the Egyptian government last April had been used to justify  systemic silencing of civil society.  He cited reports of waves of arrests, arbitrary detention, black-listing, travel bans, asset freezes, intimidation and other reprisals against human rights defenders, journalists, political dissidents and those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood group. Last week Egypt came under fire from Human Rights Watch, which said in a report that there was systemic torture in the country s jails, leading Cairo to block access to HRW s website. Egypt s human rights parliamentary committee, which was critical of the report, has also developed an action plan in response, state media reported on Tuesday. The plan reportedly includes meeting with foreign diplomats in Egypt and outside the country to explain its efforts to defend human rights.

This is the result of a society that believed the government is more capable of running their lives than they are. This is Bernie s world. This is the reality of the utopia Bernie has been promising his supporters. These are the same policies Hillary is promising she ll support if she s able to escape federal prosecution before the election. By morning, three newborns were already dead.The day had begun with the usual hazards: chronic shortages of antibiotics, intravenous solutions, even food. Then a blackout swept over the city, shutting down the respirators in the maternity ward.Doctors kept ailing infants alive by pumping air into their lungs by hand for hours. By nightfall, four more newborns had died. The death of a baby is our daily bread,  said Dr. Osleidy Camejo, a surgeon in the nation s capital, Caracas, referring to the toll from Venezuela s collapsing hospitals.The economic crisis in this country has exploded into a public health emergency, claiming the lives of untold numbers of Venezuelans. It is just part of a larger unraveling here that has become so severe it has prompted President Nicol s Maduro to impose a state of emergency and has raised fears of a government collapse.Hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing Venezuela apart have converged. Gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals. Often, cancer medicines are found only on the black market. There is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.At the University of the Andes Hospital in the mountain city of M rida, there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table. Doctors preparing for surgery cleaned their hands with bottles of seltzer water. It is like something from the 19th century,  said Dr. Christian Pino, a surgeon at the hospital.The figures are devastating. The rate of death among babies under a month old increased more than a hundredfold in public hospitals run by the Health Ministry, to just over 2 percent in 2015 from 0.02 percent in 2012, according to a government report provided by lawmakers.The rate of death among new mothers in those hospitals increased by almost five times in the same period, according to the report.This nation has the largest oil reserves in the world, yet the government saved little money for hard times when oil prices were high. Now that prices have collapsed   they are around a third what they were in 2014   the consequences are casting a destructive shadow across the country. Lines for food, long a feature of life in Venezuela, now erupt into looting. The bol var, the country s currency, is nearly worthless.The crisis is aggravated by a political feud between Venezuela s leftists, who control the presidency, and their rivals in congress. The president s opponents declared a humanitarian crisis in January, and this month passed a law that would allow Venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the health care system. This is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil, and people are dying for lack of antibiotics,  says Oneida Guaipe, a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.But Mr. Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Ch vez, went on television and rejected the effort, describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system. I doubt that anywhere in the world, except in Cuba, there exists a better health system than this one,  Mr. Maduro said.For entire story: NYT sMuch like the drooling college students who are turning out by the tens of thousands to  Bernie Sanders rally s in the United States, the citizens of Venezuela elected the controversial Nicolas Maduro as their president, and now they are paying a very heavy price.  BBC  While he lacks the magnetism followers of Mr Chavez attributed to the late president, he is a commanding figure in Venezuela, and not just because of his stature of (6ft 3in).Derided as a poor copy of his mentor, Mr Maduro has not been ousted by the opposition or by rivals in his own party, as some had predicted when he was elected in April 2013.However, he has failed to win over the opposition after sticking very closely to the fiery rhetoric of Mr Chavez.Tough stance His government s tough approach to mass anti-government protests in the first half of 2014 and the jailing of thousands of demonstrators prompted criticism from human rights groups and sanctions from the United States.His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party s control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup.But with oil prices plummeting below $50 ( 33) a barrel, Mr Maduro s approval rating has been falling, too.Venezuela s economy is almost entirely reliant on its oil exports and the president is facing a severe economic crisis as well as a hostile opposition.And with financing for the government s generous social programs in jeopardy, some are questioning how committed those who voted for Mr Maduro really are to the socialist cause and their leader. \",\n          \"The LAPD has officially launched a \\u201cKnock, Knock\\u201d Burglary Task Force in an effort to stop   targeted burglaries of celebrity homes.

As reported overnight, Xi Jinping stated that China will meet its economic goals AND win the battle vs. the virus, and Beijing is urging firms to increase output even as the capital itself is largely locked down  and other cities are physically locking people into their homes. Thats as even the US admits that the Phase One trade deal will be slow off the market due to the virus impact.\\nOf course, China is no stranger to Double Think: as Every put it, a freely-floating, controlled currency; market-determined, state-directed interest rates; and free-trade mercantilism. Yet increase economic activity from here and the virus will spread, both internally and globally. Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.\\nThat, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw Chinas dialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis and concluded that things are going to get nasty for economies and markets  especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.\\nToday, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijings order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the companys 200+ employees couldnt go home and were immediately placed under quarantine. At least the workers managed to organize quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldnt go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves.\\n\\nThis is just the first such case. Expect many more  especially across Hubei and its neighboring provinces  as latent cases of Coronavirus which were never caught and cured spark new infections and mini epidemics, all of which dutifully captured on a smartphone clip for everyone in China to watch and freak out even more.\\nWhich reminds us of another comment from Rabobank, which last week explained why the dilemma facing China is truly awful:\\nThe quandary for China between releasing the quarantine straitjacket in days to stop its economy from getting truly sick, and allowing a virus like this to spread further as people start to mingle again is truly awful. There are no good options. For a world with a serious lack of final end-demand, and which has been relying on China, along with increasingly Chinese central banks, this is going to be a nasty shock either way that Mr Market is treating like he is Mr Magoo.\\nAnd since Beijing has no way out, especially since the epidemic is still raging despite Beijings doctored, no pun intended, infection and death numbers, expect China to unleash the most draconian censorship crackdown on any reports Covid-2019 has not only not been purged but is making unwelcome appearances across Chinas enterprises, which will be quietly put under blanket quarantine even as Beijing pretends that all is well and its economy is once again humming on all cylinders until eventually the epidemic reaches a critical mass and China has no choice but to once again admit the full extent of the social and economic fallout. And just like in the case of SARS, dont expect such honesty to emerge for at least several weeks if not months.\",\n          \"Republicans hate it. They really really hate it, but after more than seven years of trying to work across the aisle, President Obama s administration has given up and is taking matters into its own hands, this time to save Planned Parenthood, forever.The rule, by the Department of Health and Human Services, if enacted, would cut Title X funding to states that cut funding to Planned Parenthood.The Title X program provides basic preventive health care and family planning services for 4 million low-income Americans. About 85 percent of patients who use Title X have incomes below $23,500. Planned Parenthood serves about a third of those patients, using the $70 million a year it receives in Title X grants to subsidize contraceptives and cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings for people who can t afford them. Title X does not allow any money to be used to pay for abortions for any reason.Still, politicians in 11 states have voted to block public funds from Planned Parenthood because its services include abortion. Republicans in Congress are also on a mission to defund the family planning provider, citing a series of debunked undercover videos produced by anti-abortion activists that purport to show Planned Parenthood selling fetal body parts. Source: Huffington PostRepublicans have had Planned Parenthood in their crosshairs for years. Ostensibly it s because Planned Parenthood performs abortions, but only three percent of what they do is about abortions. The rest is about family planning and both women s and men s health services. In other words, Planned Parenthood prevents far more abortions than they could ever perform.Besides, their objection to Planned Parenthood has nothing whatsoever to do with abortion. Republicans consistently cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, despite the fact that no federal money and very little state money goes toward abortions. In other words, it s highly unlikely you ve ever paid a penny in taxes that has gone to abort a fetus.So, what is the problem with Planned Parenthood? Well, the problem is that most Republicans in Congress and in the states believe it s the 18th century and that women should be punished for having sex. Sure, they might agree to Planned Parenthood performing mammograms, but g-d forbid they do anything with lady parts or anything that would imply a woman is having sex without a) being married and b) wanting to procreate.Just this week, Congress blocked funding to fight the Zika virus by you got it sticking an amendment in there that would block funding to Planned Parenthood.Perhaps that was the last straw and that s why the Department of Health and Human Services proposed this new rule.Planned Parenthood is breathing a sigh of relief: This will make a real difference in so many people s lives,  said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood.  Thanks to the Obama administration, women will still be able to access the birth control they need to plan their families, and the cancer screenings they need to stay healthy. That s not the only defeat anti-choice Republicans have faced this week. A judge in very conservative Utah ruled that the state cannot cut funding to Planned Parenthood.Perhaps this is a sign that the pendulum is finally beginning to swing the other direction. Perhaps soon, women will get a say in our own health choices.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.\",\n          \"School restart date to be determined next week Renato Marques Wednesday, January 29, 2020 \\nThe Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Elsie Ao Ieong U, announced yesterday that the date for school institutions to resume teaching activities will only be known during the first week of February. Ao Ieong was speaking at the daily press conference organized by the health authorities to provide updates on the local situation of the Wuhan coronavirus, now referred to as 2019-nCoV. Without giving many details, the Secretary hinted that the current postponement date of February 10 for the return to school for students of all levels announced last week by the government might be under reconsideration and a final decision will be only known during the first week of next month. The postponement of classes was among the measures first announced by the government to respond to the outbreak of the coronavirus in Macau. In a statement, the government announced that schools and other academic institutions would not resume their teaching activities at least until February 10. However, the statement alluded to the possibility that a further delay could be enforced at any moment depending on the local status of the disease. The Education and Youth Affairs Bureau (DSEJ) issued a statement earlier in the week calling all students and teachers that have spent their Spring Festival holidays in the mainland to return to the region no later than February 2. The statement also requested that after students and teachers arrive in Macau they stay at home and pay attention to [their] physical condition, and immediately seek out a doctor if they feel unwell. Such measures have been enforced by the government as a way to contain the possible spread of the disease in Macau, especially among the student population. The DSEJ also informed that it had notified schools to prepare study materials so students under this form of quarantine could continue to study and engage in pedagogical activities from home via e-learning platforms and social media groups. Similar measures were enforced by the Higher Education Bureau (DSES) that also suggested the possibility of the further postponement of classes, calling all students to stay alert and pay close attention to and announcements from the SAR government. Additionally, the Bureau informed that the Centre for Higher Education Students will be closed from January 30 until further notice, cancelling all the activities on program and venue reservations. The DSES also noted that a series of five sessions of the Seminar Series on Further Studies Outside Macau and Public Examinations which were scheduled to be held in February will be only broadcast live on the Student Blog Macao Facebook fan page, as it was no longer possible to attend them in person. In the meantime, several institutions that provide tutoring, support, and continuing education programs have also announced that they are following the government guidelines and suspending all the activities until further notice. Ao Ieong also announced that the government has decided to suspend the activities of all nurseries subsidized by the government. This is a preventive measure which the secretary said was related to the acknowledgment of the infection of a nine-month-old child on the mainland. Ao Ieong took the opportunity to call on all private nurseries that operate independently from government subsidies to also remain closed. We understand that some parents have difficulties taking care of their children without the nurseries, she said, but health should be the main priority. A few days earlier, the Social Welfare Bureau decided to exempt nurseries from the forced closures but advised parents to avoid bringing their children to these institutions after the Lunar New Year holidays as much as possible. In its statement, the bureau informed that these institutions would continue to operate but that parents were discouraged to make use of them.

The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture \",\n          \"The father of a Virginia reporter who was shot to death last year, along with her cameraman, has some extremely strong words for Republicans over their refusal to do anything about gun violence. He reserved his most scathing words for Trump, though, who actively promotes the idea that the 2nd Amendment is under heavy assault and we re just a breath away from losing all our guns.Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison Parker, was murdered by a disgruntled employee on television, made it his mission to end gun violence after her death. He rails at Republicans who are in the pockets of the all-too powerful NRA in an op-ed for the New York Daily News, which was a full-scale attack on them, and especially on Trump: Politicians like Paul Ryan, Mike McCaul and Bob Goodlatte know better. They re not knuckle-draggers waving Confederate flags at Trump rallies, but they still fall in lockstep behind their orange-faced Fuhrer who promotes this  assault on the Second Amendment  nonsense. Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out.  [emphasis mine] Orange-faced Fuhrer.  That s a good description. That s a fantastic description of Trump and his relationship to the GOP! Trump is not just promoting the very things that have led to increased gun violence here, he s far more likely than anybody else to become the dictator America (especially Republicans) have always feared.Parker went on to say that he d confronted Bob Goodlatte after a speech about slain police officers, in which Goodlatte never once mentioned guns, and asked him how he sleeps at night. Apparently, Goodlatte had no answer for that. Parker said,  As usual, he looked like he d swallowed a lemon. Trump and the NRA s minions in the GOP grossly insult all the victims of gun violence by fear-mongering about Democrats trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment. It s like a game to them; who can come up with the most guilt-trippy argument against sensible gun legislation? Here s what former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh did:Liberals shout  women s equality , yet they seek to strip women of their 2nd Amendment rights. #WomensEqualityDay pic.twitter.com/7vOCNocqPO  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 26, 2016How disgusting to use rape victims and women s equality as a rallying cry for their guns, guns, guns everywhere nonsense. But that s what the GOP and their standard-bearer, the Orange-Faced Fuhrer, do nonstop. They use victims of violence to expand the very thing that harmed them in the first place.Parker vows to continue the fight and move the needle on the national conversation about gun violence, and that means fighting against the GOP and the NRA. He had this to say in his op-ed, too: Their bloody hands are egregiously in the pockets of the NRA and they are afraid to pull them out. That is the truth.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education, a newspaper reported on Friday. South Africa s rand weakened on Thursday after comments by President Jacob Zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education, which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances.  The Mail & Guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to Zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit.  Options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing, infrastructure and the armed forces. A freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards, the newspaper reported. The Presidency and Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several South African universities last year, underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race. South Africa is staring down the barrel of ratings downgrades after the Treasury last month widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product while lowering this year s economic growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"metadata\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27662,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'author': 'Bill Proctor', 'factcheck_analysis_link': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/feb/23/bill-proctor/rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-/', 'factcheck_date': '2/23/2012', 'factchecker': 'Amy Sherman', 'statement_date': '1/6/2012', 'statement_source': 'news'}]\",\n          \"[{'author': 'Donald Trump Jr.', 'factcheck_analysis_link': 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/05/donald-trump-jr/no-wisconsin-voter-turnout-did-not-jump-67-2016-89/', 'factcheck_date': '11/5/2020', 'factchecker': 'Eric Litke', 'statement_date': '11/4/2020', 'statement_source': 'social_media'}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SCIENCE\",\n          \"POLITICS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 0.1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1854.9510556891355,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 6423.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6406,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2490.0,\n          5493.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2889,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"officialroycey\",\n          \"DistressCentreO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_full['label'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-JzOT6TytL4f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713469144909,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":336,"user":{"displayName":"Svetlana Esina","userId":"00933202399777418469"}},"outputId":"167262f0-d434-4189-f2fd-14632aa255b0"},"id":"-JzOT6TytL4f","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["label\n","1    26579\n","0    25786\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.0"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
